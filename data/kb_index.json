Common Denominators of Fire Behavior on Tragedy Fires ● Most incidents happen on the smaller fires or on isolated portions of larger fires. ● Most fires are innocent in appearance before the \"flare- ups\" or \"blow-ups.\" In some cases, tragedies occur in the mop-up stage. ● Flare-ups generally occur in deceptively light fuels. ● Fires run uphill surprisingly fast in chimneys, gullies, and on steep slopes. ● Some suppression tools, such as helicopters or air tankers, can adversely affect fire behavior. The blasts of air from low flying helicopters and air tankers have been known to cause flare-ups."

It is a tool used to encourage the reporting of any condition, observance, act, maintenance problem, or circumstance that has the potential to cause an aviation or aviation-related accident. It can also be used for reporting positive safety actions and mishap prevention measures. Submitting a SAFECOM is not a substitute for on-the- spot correction(s) to a safety concern. While it is imperative that problems and issues be addressed at the local level, it is beneficial to share problems and solutions system wide.

This annual initiative invites all leadership and wildland fire management students to engage with essential skills and knowledge needed to lead effectively in dynamic environments.\n\nThis quarter focuses on Leadership Level 2: New Leader (Conveying Intent). Conveying intent is a crucial leadership competency in the high-risk, dynamic environment of wildland firefighting. Months 4 - 6 will concentrate on how successfully conveying intent enhances situational awareness, promotes shared understanding, and empowers firefighters to exercise initiative and adapt to changing conditions.\n\n### References:"

It is a tool that leaders, teams, crews, and units can use to get maximum learning benefit from every incident or project. It is essential for wildland firefighters to learn from mistakes and to capitalize on successes. It is considered a valuable tool in high-risk professions, where the smallest mistakes can lead to disastrous results. **An AAR is not a critique and not a forum to assign blame.

Try to get to the root of the issue. The leader must be a part of the AAR and will have to accept criticism. This is important because the team will be looking for affirmation of the AAR process."
