Ten Standard Fire Orders FIRE BEHAVIOR 1. Keep informed on fire weather conditions and forecasts. 2. Know what your fire is doing at all times. 3. Base all actions on current and expected behavior of the fire. FIRELINE SAFETY 4. Identify Escape Routes and Safety Zones and make them known. 5. Post Lookouts when there is possible danger. 6. Be Alert. Keep Calm. Think Clearly. Act Decisively. ORGANIZATIONAL CONTROL 7. Maintain prompt communication with your forces, your supervisor, and adjoining forces. 8. Give clear instructions and ensure they are understood. 9. Maintain control of your forces at all times. IF YOU CONSIDERED 1 THROUGH 9, THEN 10. Fight fire aggressively, having provided for safety first. Common Denominators of Fire Behavior on Tragedy Fires ● Most incidents happen on the smaller fires or on isolated portions of larger fires. ● Most fires are innocent in appearance before the "flare- ups" or "blow-ups." In some cases, tragedies occur in the mop-up stage. ● Flare-ups generally occur in deceptively light fuels. ● Fires run uphill surprisingly fast in chimneys, gullies, and on steep slopes. ● Some suppression tools, such as helicopters or air tankers, can adversely affect fire behavior. The blasts of air from low flying helicopters and air tankers have been known to cause flare-ups.

INTRODUCTION Area Command is an expansion of the incident command function primarily designed to manage a complex or large incident/event or an area that has multiple incident management organizations assigned. An Area Command may be established when incidents are close enough that oversight is required among the incident management organizations to ensure conflicts do not arise. The function of the Area Command is to develop broad objectives for the impacted area and coordinate the development of individual incident objectives and strategies. Additionally, the Area Command will set priorities for the use of critical resources among multiple incident management organizations or allocate/reallocate resources during a single large-scale incident/event. An Area Command organization is normally small with personnel assigned to Command, Planning and Logistics functions. Depending on the complexity of the interface between the incidents, specialists in other areas such as aviation, hazardous materials, environment, and finance may also be assigned to Area Command. 2017 ICS 420-1 AREA COMMAND 3-2

ZONE A Zone is a tool that may be used in Area Command. A standardized Area Command implementation plan, and operating policies and procedures should be developed, fully integrated, understood, and exercised prior to implementation. Pre-incident planning, coordination, training, and exercises are defined as Preparedness Elements of NIMS. Zone – A defined geographic area or function utilized to support the management of an Incident (i.e., Area Command). A Zone may be assigned an Incident Management Team(s) or IC to provide management of a defined area or function. Zones may be identified geographically, numerically, or by functional name. Geographic Zones are primarily used to provide an effective span of control. Area Command can use Functional Zones by assigning resources or assisting Cooperating Agencies in a logistical support role. This can also be used during Pre-Planned Events, Natural Disasters, or Public Health emergencies for the distribution of equipment and/or supplies from defined points with or without being involved in actual incident operations. 2017 ICS 420-1 AREA COMMAND 3-17

ESTABLISHMENT AND TRANSFER OF COMMAND The highest-ranking official of the jurisdictional agency at the scene of the incident initially establishes Command. The Incident Commander is responsible for overall management of the incident. It is his/her responsibility to prepare the Incident Objectives that, in turn, will be the foundation upon which subsequent incident action planning will be based. Incident Objectives will be based on the requirements of the agency and the incident. They should be broad, measurable, and follow an ordered sequence of events. The Transfer of Command checklist below provides a basic guideline that can be used in almost any incident situation. This information may be captured on the Incident Briefing (ICS Form 201). However, agency policies and incident-specific issues may require alterations to the Transfer of Command process. When it is determined that a Transfer of Command (face-to- face) briefing needs to take place, the minimum essential information should include the following: a. Situation Status b. Objectives and Priorities c. Current Organization d. Resource Assignments e. Resources En Route and/or Ordered f. Facilities Established g. Communications Plan h. Prognosis, Concerns – Related Issues As incidents grow in size or complexity, most agencies will transfer command one or more times. Whenever the Transfer of Command briefing takes place, the information conveyed should be recorded and displayed for easy retrieval and subsequent briefings. 2017 ICS 420-1 COMMAND COMMAND 5-3

POSITION CHECKLISTS INCIDENT COMMANDER – The Incident Commander (ICT1, ICT2, ICT3, ICT4, or ICT5) is responsible for the overall management of the incident. On most incidents, a single Incident Commander carries out the command activity. However, Unified Command may be appropriate. The Incident Commander is selected by qualifications and experience. The Incident Commander may have a Deputy (DPIC), who may be from the same agency or from an assisting agency. Deputies may also be used at Section and Branch levels of the ICS organization. Deputies must have the same qualifications as the person for whom they work, as they must be ready to take over that position at any time: a. Review Chapter 1 Common Responsibilities. b. Assess the situation and/or obtain a briefing from the prior Incident Commander. c. Determine Incident Objectives and strategy. d. Establish the immediate priorities. e. Establish an Incident Command Post. f. Consider the need for Unified Command. g. Establish an appropriate organization. h. Ensure planning meetings are scheduled as required. i. Approve and authorize the implementation of an Incident Action Plan (IAP). j. Ensure that adequate safety and personnel accountability measures are in place. k. Coordinate activity for all Command and General Staff. l. Coordinate with key people and officials. m. Approve requests for additional resources or for the release of resources. n. Keep Agency Administrator informed of incident status. o. Approve the use of trainees, volunteers, and auxiliary personnel. 2017 ICS 420-1 COMMAND COMMAND 5-4

Order the demobilization of the incident when appropriate. s. Maintain Unit/Activity Log (ICS Form 214). Delegation of Authority : A statement provided to the Incident Commander by the Agency Administrator delegating authority and assigning responsibility. The Delegation of Authority can include objectives, priorities, expectations, constraints, and other considerations or guidelines as needed. Many agencies require written Delegation of Authority to be given to Incident Commanders prior to their assuming command on larger incidents. PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER – The Public Information Officer (PIO1, PIO2, PIO3, or PIOF) is responsible for developing and releasing information about the incident to the news media, to incident personnel, and to other appropriate agencies and organizations. Only one Public Information Officer will be assigned for each incident, including incidents operating under Unified Command and multi-jurisdiction incidents. The Public Information Officer may have Assistant Public Information Officers as necessary, and the Assistant Public Information Officers may also represent assisting agencies or jurisdictions. Agencies have different policies and procedures relative to the handling of public information. The following are the major responsibilities of the Public Information Officer that would generally apply on any incident: a. Review Chapter 1 Common Responsibilities. b. Determine from the Incident Commander if there are any limits on information release. c. Develop material for use in media briefings. 2017 ICS 420-1 COMMAND COMMAND 5-5

## Page 48

UNIFIED COMMAND Experience has proven that at incidents involving multi-agencies, there is a critical need for integrating management of resources into one operational organization that is managed and supported by one command structure. This is best established through an integrated, multi-disciplined organization. In the ICS, employing what is known as Unified Command fills this critical need. Unified Command is a team effort that allows all agencies with jurisdictional responsibility for an incident, either geographical or functional, to participate in the management of the incident. Developing and implementing a common set of incident objectives and strategies demonstrate this participation that all can subscribe to, without losing or abdicating agency authority, responsibility, or accountability. Those organizations that participate in Unified Command should have statutory responsibility for some portion of the incident or event. Assisting and cooperating agencies with no statutory responsibility that nonetheless contribute resources to the incident should not function at the Unified Command level. These agencies should instead assign Agency Representatives to effectively represent their agencies and resources through the Liaison Officer. In these ways, the principles that define Unified Command provide all of the necessary mechanisms for organizational representation and inter-agency management within a multi-agency incident response. At a local level, frequent training and realistic exercises involving those agencies that may be represented at actual incidents should be considered a prerequisite for successful management of multi-agency incidents. These activities serve to familiarize each participating agency of their respective roles and responsibilities and to clarify the capabilities and limitations of each agency. For example, a planned event such as a parade or air show may provide an opportunity for local, state, and federal agencies to operate in a Unified Command structure. 2017 ICS 420-1 UNIFIED COMMAND 6-2

## Page 49

A successfully managed multi-agency incident will occur only when the participating agencies’ personnel have confidence in each other’s competencies, authorities, responsibilities, and limitations as they relate to the incident. Beyond the associated processes, guidelines, and exercises is the requirement for an attitude of cooperation. Coordinated strategy, tactics, and resource utilization to accomplish incident control must be the focus of all agencies at the scene. Within a Unified Command, one person is selected as spokesperson for the groups. Typically, the person representing the agency with the highest resource commitment or most visible activity on the incident is selected. In some cases, this task may simply be assigned to the person with the most experience. Unified Command incorporates the following principles: a. One set of objectives is developed for the entire incident. b. A collective approach is used to develop strategies to achieve incident goals. c. Improved information flow and coordination between all jurisdictions and agencies involved in the incident. d. All agencies with responsibility for the incident have an understanding of one another's priorities and restrictions. e. No agency's authority or legal requirements will be compromised or neglected. f. Each agency is fully aware of the plans, actions, and constraints of all others. g. The combined efforts of all agencies are optimized as they perform their respective assignments under a single Incident Action Plan. h. Duplicative efforts are reduced or eliminated, reducing cost and chances for frustration and conflict. 2017 ICS 420-1 UNIFIED COMMAND 6-3

## Page 50

INITIAL UNIFIED COMMAND MEETING CHECKLIST It is essential to begin unified planning as early as possible. Initiate Unified Command as soon as two or more agencies having jurisdictional or functional responsibilities come together on an incident. It is especially important on those incidents where there may be competing priorities based on agency responsibilities. All of the jurisdictional agencies’ Incident Commanders need to get together before the first operational period planning meeting in an Initial Unified Command Meeting. This meeting provides the responsible agency officials with an opportunity to discuss and concur on important issues prior to joint incident action planning. The agenda for the command meeting should include the following: a. Present jurisdictional/agency priorities and objectives. b. Present jurisdictional limitations, concerns, and restrictions. c. Develop a collective set of incident objectives. d. Establish and agree on acceptable priorities. e. Adopt an overall strategy or strategies to accomplish objectives. f. Agree on the basic organization structure. g. Designate the most qualified and acceptable Operations Section Chief. The Operations Section Chief will normally be from the jurisdiction or agency that has the greatest involvement in the incident, although that is not essential. h. Agree on General Staff personnel designations and planning, logistical, and finance agreements and procedures. i. Agree on resource ordering process to be followed. j. Agree on cost-sharing procedures. k. Agree on informational matters. l. Designate one agency official to act as Unified Command spokesperson. 2017 ICS 420-1 UNIFIED COMMAND 6-4

## Page 51

The members of the Unified Command must be authorized to perform certain activities and actions on behalf of the jurisdiction or agency they represent. Such activities include ordering of additional resources in support of the Incident Action Plan, possible loaning or sharing of resources to other jurisdictions, and agreeing to financial cost-sharing arrangements with participating agencies. UNIFIED COMMAND MEETING REQUIREMENTS Unified Incident Commanders should meet prior to the Incident Planning Meeting to discuss a number of key items. This meeting will serve to clarify issues and to provide direction to other incident personnel who will develop the formal Incident Action Plan. The following checklist provides a series of items to be addressed during the meeting between Incident Commanders where the development of incident strategy and objectives is done: a. The Command Meeting should include only agency Incident Commanders. b. The meeting should be brief, and important points should be documented. The important points should include agency capabilities and limitations, functional and jurisdictional responsibilities, and the individual agency’s objectives. c. Prior to the meeting, the respective responsible officials should have reviewed the purposes and agenda items described above, and be prepared to discuss them. The end result of the planning process will be a single Incident Action Plan that addresses multi-jurisdiction or multi-agency priorities and objectives, and provides an appropriate level of tactical direction and resource assignments for the unified effort. 2017 ICS 420-1 UNIFIED COMMAND 6-5

PLANNING PROCESS The checklist below provides basic steps appropriate for use in almost any incident situation. However, not all incidents require written plans, and the need for written plans and attachments may be based on incident requirements and the decision of the Incident Command. The Planning Checklist is to be used with the Operation Planning Worksheet (ICS Form 215-G/W). For more detailed instructions, see Planning Section Chief Position Manual (ICS 221-1). The Operations Section Chief should have a draft Operational Planning Worksheet (ICS Form 215-G/W) and the Safety Officer should have a draft Incident Safety Analysis (ICS Form 215-AG/AW) completed prior to the planning meeting. Incident objectives and strategy should be established before the planning meeting. For this purpose it may be necessary to hold a strategy meeting prior to the planning meeting. The Planning Process works best when the incident is divided into logical geographical and/or functional units. The tactics and resources are then determined for each of the planning units, and then the planning units are combined into divisions/ groups utilizing span-of-control guidelines. The Operational Planning Worksheet (ICS Form 215-G/W) and the Incident Safety Analysis (ICS Form 215-AG/AW) are used to support the incident’s planning process. They provide the Incident Commander, Command, and General Staff with the means to identify Division or Group assignments, develop specific tactics, identify available and needed resources, and address safety considerations. During this process, safety issues identified must be mitigated or new tactics developed to adequately address safety concerns. 2017 ICS 420-1 PLANNING PROCESS 7-2

WILDLAND FIRE ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT The following series of organization charts depict examples of how the Incident Command System can be used on fires involving wildland (grass, brush, timber fuels). The charts show examples of ICS organizations for initial attack fires through incidents that grow to such size as to require very large organizational structures to manage the personnel and equipment assigned to these incidents. Certain terms are used to identify the level of resource commitment or organizational structure. The terms associated with these levels are: Initial Attack Organization : This example depicts an agency’s initial response level (four engines, a bulldozer, a wildland firefighting handcrew, one helicopter and one Command Officer) to a reported wildland fire and how those resources might be organized to handle the situation. At the same time, the organization is designed to rapidly expand if necessitated by fire growth. Reinforced Response Organization : This example depicts an expansion of the organizational structure to accommodate additional resources. Extended Attack Organization : This example depicts an organization that may be appropriate for incidents that may require even more resources and an extended period of time to control. The time frames for these incidents may run into multiple operational periods covering many days with enhanced logistics and planning requirements. Multi-Branch Response Organization : This example depicts an organization that may be used for wildland incidents that have grown in area to require multiple levels of management to accommodate span of control concerns and increased support for the number of personnel assigned to the incident. 2017 ICS 420-1 ORGANIZATIONAL GUIDES 12-3

WILDLAND FIRE – INITIAL ATTACK ORGANIZATION INCIDENT COMMANDER Staging Area(s) Engine Engine Dozer Handcrew Engine Engine Helicopter Wildland Fire – Initial Attack Organization: Initial response resources are managed by the initial response Incident Commander (first arriving Company Officer or Command Officer) who will perform all Command and General Staff functions. Many small initial attack fires are controlled and extinguished with resource commitments at or slightly above this level. The span of control for this organization is at six to one, which is within safe guidelines of three-seven to one. Units are deployed to attack the fire with a single helicopter supporting the effort as directed by the Incident Commander. The Incident Commander has identified a Staging Area for use in the event additional resources arrive before tactical assignments for these resources are determined. 2017 ICS 420-1 ORGANIZATIONAL GUIDES 12-4

Span of control concerns as well as the need for tactical supervision have necessitated that the Incident Commander establish two Divisions with qualified Supervisors assigned. A Safety Officer is assigned to monitor incident operations for safety issues and to ensure corrective steps are taken. A Medical Unit is established to coordinate emergency medical treatment and transportation for incident personnel and to provide responder rehabilitation. The Resources Unit is established to assist the Incident Commander with tracking resources, and a Logistics Section Chief is assigned to begin planning and implementing logistical support for the assigned resources and to plan for the support of additional resources should they be ordered. 2017 ICS 420-1 ORGANIZATIONAL GUIDES 12-5

Due to the complexity of the incident and the dynamic nature of the suppression activities, the Incident Commander has established the Operations Section Chief position. Additional aviation resources have arrived and are supervised by the Air Tactical Group Supervisor. The Incident Commander has established a Situation Unit to begin collecting incident data (mapping, weather, fire behavior predictions, etc.) to aid in the strategic and tactical planning as the incident progresses. Logistical needs have required upgraded communications support. 2017 ICS 420-1 ORGANIZATIONAL GUIDES 12-6

A full Air Operations Branch with Branch Director has been established. The Planning Section is further expanded to begin production of Incident Action Plans for multiple Operational Periods. To ensure that adequate safety measures are taken within the expansive incident, Assistant Safety Officers have been assigned to the Safety Officer. These Assistants can be assigned to individual Branches or Divisions as well as to monitoring activities at the Base. The Command Staff is now complete to assist the Incident Commander with incident information handling and to interface with assisting and cooperating agencies. 2017 ICS 420-1 ORGANIZATIONAL GUIDES 12-7

STRUCTURE FIRE ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT The following series of organization charts depict examples of how the Incident Command System can be used on fires involving structures. The charts show examples of ICS organizations for initial attack fires through incidents that grow to such size as to require very large organizational structures to manage the personnel and equipment assigned to these incidents. Certain terms are used to identify the level of resource commitment or organizational structure. The terms associated with these levels are: Initial Attack Organization : This example depicts an agency’s initial response level (three Engines, one Truck Company, and a Command Officer) to a reported fire involving a building and how those resources might be organized to handle the situation. At the same time, the organization is designed to rapidly expand if necessitated by fire growth. Reinforced Response Organization : This example depicts an expansion of the organizational structure to accommodate additional resources. In this case, a second alarm has been ordered and received along with resources to assist the Incident Commander and support the personnel on scene. Multi-Branch Response Organization : This example depicts an organization that may be used for incidents that have grown in area to require multiple levels of management to accommodate span of control concerns and increased support for the number of personnel assigned to the incident. 2017 ICS 420-1 ORGANIZATIONAL GUIDES 12-8

Further development of the Operations Section could include either Divisions (Division A, B, C, and D, or Division 1, 2, and Roof for multi-story buildings) or Groups (Attack, Support, Rescue, or Ventilation) or a combination of both (Division 1, 2, and 3 and a Salvage Group may be established). The Incident Commander has activated the Safety Officer position to monitor all incident activities for safety issues and to ensure corrective actions are taken. A Medical Unit is established to coordinate emergency medical treatment and transportation for incident personnel, and to provide responder rehabilitation. In addition, the IC has established a Staging Area and a Rapid Intervention capability. The Resources Unit will assist in resource tracking. Resources Unit Medical Unit Resp.

INTRODUCTION Wildland firefighting by itself is very challenging and adding structures and other improvements into the equation greatly increases complexity. Over the last several decades, an expansion of communities, homes, and other improvements into wildland areas has created a significant challenge for the fire service agencies responsible for providing fire protection in those areas. Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) fires often overtax the local fire agency resulting in the activation of mutual aid and automatic aid agreements to augment jurisdictional resources. Nearly every WUI fire includes responses from a variety of wildland and municipal fire agencies resulting in the need for clear text and common terminology among emergency responders. This chapter on WUI operations and structure defense is designed to provide common terminology and operating principles for statewide responders. It also includes guidelines and checklists to complement and enhance first responders differing levels of training and experience. This document describes tactical actions that emphasize firefighter safety during structure defense assignments. Successful WUI firefighting operations are accomplished by selecting sound strategies supported by effective tactical actions that keep firefighters safe, protect the public, and minimize property loss. Firefighters can prepare themselves for structure defense activities by developing a sound understanding of the wildland structure environment, fire behavior and forecasting, the Risk Management process, tactical terms and associated tactical actions. An understanding of all these components will allow firefighters to safely mitigate the fire’s impact upon the values they are charged with protecting. 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-2

MODULAR DEVELOPMENT A series of examples of modular development are included to illustrate one method of expanding the incident organization: Initial Attack Organization: Initial response resources are managed by the Incident Commander (first arriving Company Officer or Command Officer) who will perform all Command and General Staff functions. The span of control for the organization is within safe guidelines of three-seven to one. Resources are deployed to attack the fire and defend structures with a single helicopter supporting the effort as directed by the Incident Commander. The Incident Commander has identified a Staging Area for use in the event additional resources arrive before tactical assignments for these resources are determined. Reinforced Response Organization: Additional resources have arrived. Span of control concerns as well as the need for tactical supervision have necessitated that the Incident Commander establish two Divisions with qualified Supervisors assigned. Division Supervisors are responsible for all objectives within their geographic area, including perimeter control and structure defense. A Safety Officer is assigned to monitor incident operations for safety issues and to ensure corrective steps are taken. The Resources Unit is established to assist the Incident Commander with tracking resources, and a Logistics Section Chief is assigned to begin planning and implementing logistical support for the assigned resources and to plan for the support of additional resources should they be ordered. Extended Attack Organization: The Incident Commander has requested and received additional resources. Due to the complexity of the incident and the dynamic nature of the suppression activities, the Incident Commander has established a Structure Defense Group and an Operations 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-3

## Page 158

Section Chief. As the Structure Defense Group conducts activities within a specific geographic area, the Structure Defense Group Supervisor must coordinate with the respective Divisions. Additional aviation resources have arrived and are supervised by the Air Tactical Group Supervisor. The Incident Commander has established a Situation Unit to begin collecting incident data (mapping, weather, fire behavior predictions, etc.) to aid in the strategic and tactical planning as the incident progresses. Incident complexity has required consideration for establishing the Communications Unit and Medical Unit. Multi-Branch Response Organization: This incident requires multiple Divisions covering a large geographic area so Branches are established within the Operations Section. One Branch Director has established a Structure Defense Group, while the other Branch Director is handling structure defense with assigned Division resources. A full Air Operations Branch has been established. The Planning Section is further expanded to begin production of Incident Action Plans for multiple Operational Periods. The Command Staff is now complete to assist the Incident Commander with needed information handling and to interface with assisting and cooperating agencies. 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-4

LEADERS INTENT The first and foremost intent during structure defense is to keep firefighters and the public safe. Secondly, once that safety can be ensured, then we can aggressively work towards keeping the wildland fire away from structures and communities. The development of all strategies and tactics should utilize the Risk Management process to ensure firefighter safety. Defending structures from a wildland fire will not be possible in every situation. Risk to firefighters, fire behavior and availability of resources will dictate the strategies that will be used. When there is a need to engage in structure defense, firefighters will ensure that they are taking safe, appropriate, and reasonable tactical actions for which they are trained and equipped. WILDLAND STRUCTURE ENVIRONMENT When making decisions on structure defense, you must consider the overall environment where the structures are located. There are two basic structure environments in the wildland. Interface – a condition where structures abut the wildland. ● There is a clear line of demarcation between the structures and the wildland fuels along roads or back fences. ● Usually identified as housing tracts or developments adjacent to a wildland area. ● There is a greater potential for house-to-house ignition. Intermix – a condition where structures are scattered throughout a wildland area: ● There is no clear line of demarcation; the wildland fuels are continuous outside of and within the developed area. 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-9

## Page 164

● Each structure must be assessed independently. ● Usually more complex to triage than an interface condition. ● Usually more complex to defend than an interface condition. ● Usually requires a higher ratio of engines to structures than an interface condition. DEFINITIONS Safety Zone – a preplanned area of sufficient size and suitable location that is expected to protect fire personnel from known hazards without using fire shelters. Temporary Refuge Area (TRA) – a preplanned area where firefighters can immediately take refuge for temporary shelter and short-term relief without using a fire shelter in the event that emergency egress to an established Safety Zone is compromised. Examples: lee side of structure, inside of structure, large lawn or parking area, cab of apparatus. Note: Although Safety Zones and viable Escape Routes shall always be identified in the WUI environment, they may not be immediately available should the fire behavior increase unexpectedly. Often a Temporary Refuge Area (TRA) is more accessible in the WUI environment. A TRA will provide temporary shelter and short-term relief from an approaching fire without use of a fire shelter and allow the responders to develop an alternate plan to safely survive the increase in fire behavior. Always have an exit strategy : □ Employ tactical maneuver to avoid heat injury, move away from the fire. □ Move to a Temporary Refuge Area. □ Withdraw along an Escape Route. □ Move into a Safety Zone. 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-10

## Page 165

FIRE BEHAVIOR FORECASTING Firefighting and public safety is the first priority in every fire management activity. Using the Standard Firefighting Orders, firefighters are guided to make a fire behavior forecast that considers the fire’s potential at the time of contact with the structure. If at any time the risk to firefighters is determined to be too great, an alternative action should be selected. It is important to remember that fire conditions can change very quickly, so constant observation and reassessment is necessary; the tactic selected may need to change. Tactical maneuver or agility is essential to ensure firefighter safety. Use standardized references to validate your fire behavior forecast: ● Incident Response Pocket Guide (IRPG) ● Look Up, Look Down, Look Around indicators ● Extreme Fire Behavior indicators (spotting, crowning, rate of spread) ● Campbell Prediction System (CPS) ● Know what the fire is doing at all times in order to maintain an accurate fire behavior forecast. ● Know current weather conditions and forecasts. Consider wind speed, direction, relative humidity, temperatures. ● Observe current burning activity in order to predict flame length and intensity. ● Consider local weather factors and fire history. ● Evaluate for wind shifts, micro-climates, weather indicators and hazards. ● Evaluate surrounding fuels for type, height, continuity, and conditions. 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-11

## Page 166

STRUCTURE DEFENSE SIZE-UP Evaluate the location of the structure and surrounding area with the forecast fire behavior in mind: ● Is the wind and slope in alignment with topography leading to the structure? ● Where is the location of the structure on the slope; canyon bottom, mid-slope, or ridge top? ● Is the structure in or near a chute, chimney, saddle, or other topographic hazard? STRUCTURE TRIAGE CATEGORIES Select the appropriate structure triage category based on the forecasted fire behavior, the surrounding area terrain, and any defensible space: Not Threatened : Safety Zone and TRA are present and construction features or defensible space make it unlikely that the structure will ignite during initial fire front contact. Threatened Defensible : Safety Zone and TRA are present and construction features, lack of defensible space, or other challenges requires firefighters to implement structure defense tactics during fire front contact. Threatened Non-Defensible : Either there is no Safety Zone or TRA present and/or the structure has challenges that do not allow firefighters to safely commit to stay and defend the structure during fire front contact. 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-12

## Page 167

STRUCTURE TRIAGE GUIDELINES Consider the following factors during structure triage: ● Forecasted fire behavior and intensity – the greater the intensity, the greater the defensible space required. ● Safety Zones should be identified and designated based upon forecasted fire behavior. ● Temporary Refuge Areas (TRA) should be preplanned and identified in the event that emergency egress to an established Safety Zone is compromised. ● Is there adequate space to park your apparatus safely based upon forecasted fire behavior? ● Do you have adequate lookout and communication capability? ● Evaluate the proximity of the fuels and forecasted flame lengths in relation to the structure; is there defensible space? ◦ What is the position of the structure on the slope relative to fire spread? ◦ Avoid narrow canyon bottoms, mid-slopes with fire below, or narrow ridges near chimneys and saddles. ● Are there narrow roads, unknown bridge limits, and septic tank hazards? ● Are there ornamental plants and combustible debris next to the structure? ● Is there an adequate water supply to support the necessary flow rates and GPM output? ● Did the property owners remain on-site? ● Does the structure have a flammable roof and/or siding (Wood roof and siding and/or vinyl siding, along with inadequate defensible space, may make the structure impossible to defend.)? ● Is there adequate time and available resources to defend the structure (If you do not have time to position resources 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-13

## Page 168

or there are a lack of resources, then it may be impractical to defend the structure.)? ● Utilize the WUI Placard ICS 231 found on: www.firescope.org STRUCTURE DEFENSE GUIDELINES Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) : ● Structure defense tactics can be undertaken utilizing standard wildland PPE. ● If the structure becomes involved in fire, and a decision is made to extinguish the fire, utilize the appropriate Structure Fire PPE, including SCBA as required. ● DO NOT enter a structure to extinguish a fire inside unless you are trained, equipped, and authorized. ● DO NOT base your decision to remain at a structure and/ or safety of your personnel on the use of SCBA. Equipment Placement : ● Identify Escape Routes, Safety Zones and TRAs and make them known to all personnel. ● STAY MOBILE and wear all of your PPE. ● Back equipment in for a quick escape. ● Park in a clear area (watch for overhead hazards). ● Protect your equipment (park behind the structure, placing the structure between equipment and fire front; be aware of spot fires occurring behind you). ● Watch for hazards (drop-offs, pot holes, above-ground fuel storage, chemicals, and septic tanks). ● Keep egress routes clear. ● Have an engine/personnel protection line charged and readily available. ● Avoid long hose lays. ● Try to keep sight contact with all personnel. 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-14

## Page 169

Water Use Guidelines : ● Keep at least 100 gallons of water reserve in your tank. ● Top off your tank at every opportunity, use a garden hose. ● Draft from a swimming pool, hot tub, or fishpond. ● Stay mobile. Be aware that hydrants may not always work if the system is electrically powered and power is lost in the area. ● Conserve water, avoid wetting down an area. ● Apply water only if it controls fire spread or significantly reduces the heating of the structure being defended. ● Keep fire out of the heavier fuels. ● Extinguish fire at its lowest intensity, not when it is flaring up. ● Have enough water to last for the duration of the main heat wave and to protect personnel. Class A Foam/Gel Use Guidelines : ● Direct Attack with Class A Foam - apply to base of flame. ● Apply Class A Foam to structure (roof and siding) 10-15 minutes before fire arrives. ● Foam or gel the structure and the vegetation immediately surrounding the structure. Preparing the Structure : ● Determine if residents are home. If so, advise them to leave. ● For roof access, place the owner’s ladder at a corner of the structure on the side with the least fire threat and away from the power drop. ● Clear the area around above-ground fuel tanks, shutting off tanks. ● Place combustible outside furniture inside the structure. ● Close windows and doors, including garage, leaving unlocked. 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-15

## Page 170

● Remove combustibles immediately next to the structure and scatter firewood. ● Construct a fire line around out-buildings, power poles and fuel tanks. ● Remove vegetation from the immediate area of the structure. ● Have garden hose(s) charged and placed strategically around structure for immediate use. ● MAY USE THE STRUCTURE AS A TEMPORARY REFUGE AREA (TRA). STRUCTURE DEFENSE STRATEGIES The IC or Operations Section Chief (when assigned) is responsible for establishing the strategy. The strategy should reflect a “general” plan that is broad in scope and provides direction for accomplishing the incident objectives. For example, the strategy for defending structures on the right flank of a WUI fire may be to keep the fire away from homes using a coordinated direct attack with aircraft, dozers and crews. At the same time the strategy for controlling the left flank on the same fire may be to develop an indirect attack, utilizing a small Task Force to burn out along a series of small dirt roads and create a line that will stop the fire from spreading. The strategy must reflect a realistic approach for meeting the objectives for all portions of the fire. The strategy must take into consideration the numbers and types of resources necessary to accomplish the incident objectives and the reflex time it will take to have them in position. A strategy that requires a large number of resources to execute the plan will fail if the needed resources cannot arrive in a timely fashion. The strategy is also subject to change due to changes in weather, fire behavior, resource availability and any change 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-16

## Page 171

with the objectives. For example, firefighters planning to burnout from a road system a mile from the fire front may be forced to change to a direct suppression strategy if a forecast calling for cool weather with accompanying moisture is predicted to arrive before the burnout can be executed. STRUCTURE DEFENSE TACTICS Where the strategy gives firefighters a general plan, tactics are the specific actions firefighters will take to accomplish the incident objectives. The choice of which tactic to use can come in the form of direction from the IC or the Operations Section Chief or it may be a decision made by the unit or resource supervisor. The chosen tactical action must be capable of stopping the advance of the fire or preventing the fire from damaging property and doing so without incurring injuries to firefighting personnel. This means that when choosing a tactical action or when making a tactical plan, it is very important to know what the fire behavior will be at the time firefighters engage the fire. Making an accurate fire behavior forecast in advance of the fire's arrival is the wildland firefighter’s greatest challenge. An accurate fire behavior forecast is difficult to make with absolute certainty, but it serves as the basis for determining if a tactical action will be effective and safe. Recognizing that there is always the potential for error in our fire behavior forecast means that we must compensate for the uncertainties by having alternative actions (tactical maneuver) built into the plan. The key point here is to never get locked into a single plan of action. 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-17

## Page 172

TACTICAL MANEUVER Tactical maneuver implies movement or purposeful reaction to change. Tactical maneuver builds agility into a tactical plan by allowing resources to work and move around in a hazardous environment without injury, while remaining effective. Tactical maneuver is most effective when potential changes to the primary plan have been identified and firefighters reactions to those changes are planned out. Firefighters must prepare to utilize tactical maneuver when changing from structure defense mode (defensive) to suppression mode (offensive) when fire behavior allows. It is imperative to take advantage of situations that allow for firefighters to take perimeter control actions and suppress the fire. Tactical planning must be developed in conjunction with anticipated changes in the fire environment, or fire behavior. Tactical maneuver ( agility ) is essential to ensure firefighter safety since legitimate Safety Zones are not always immediately present in the WUI. Firefighters should focus on agile tactical solutions to unanticipated changes as opposed to a rigid and inflexible plan. The tactic selected may need to change to compensate for a change in the fire’s behavior. Always have a way out! Tactical maneuver can be an offensive or defensive action. Be prepared to move decisively during lulls in fire activity or take shelter in Temporary Refuge Areas or Safety Zones when the fire is active. Examples of tactical maneuver would be an engine crew going from one structure to another, moving with the fire, or staying behind a house when the fire is hitting hard and moving into full suppression mode when the fire subsides. This requires a continuous assessment of the fire and its potential. Crews must continually identify Temporary Refuge Areas and Routes to Safety Zones. 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-18

## Page 173

STRUCTURE DEFENSE TACTICAL ACTIONS After making a fire behavior forecast and triage of the assigned structures, responders must now implement the necessary tactics to defend the structure(s) from the advancing fire front. Supervisors must keep in close communication with those they supervise and adjoining forces in the area. The following are the seven tactical actions available to structure defense resources: ● Check and Go ● Prep and Go ● Prep and Defend ● Fire Front Following ● Bump and Run ● Anchor and Hold ● Tactical Patrol CHECK AND GO Check and Go is a rapid evaluation to check for occupants requiring removal or rescue: ● Structure Triage Category – Threatened Non-Defensible ● This tactic is most appropriate when there is no Safety Zone or TRA present and the forecasted fire spread, intensity, and the projected impact time of the fire front prohibit resources from taking preparation action to defend the structure. ● Complete a rapid evaluation to check for occupants at a structure, evaluate life threatened and assist in evacuation. ● Used when fire spread, intensity, lack of time or inadequate defensible space prohibit firefighting resources from safely taking action to defend the home when the fire front arrives. 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-19

## Page 174

● Evaluate the structure for follow-up action when additional resources become available, the fire front passes, or fire behavior intensity is reduced. PREP AND GO Prep and Go implies that some preparation of the structure may be safely completed prior to resources leaving the area: ● Structure Triage Category – Threatened Non-Defensible ● A tactic used when a Safety Zone and TRA are not present and/or when fire spread and intensity are too dangerous to stay in the area when the fire front arrives, but there is adequate time to prepare a structure for defense ahead of the fire front. ● Utilized for structures where potential fire intensity makes it too dangerous for fire resources to stay when the fire front arrives. ● There is some time to prepare a structure ahead of the fire; resources should engage in rapid, prioritized fire defense preparations and foam the structure prior to leaving. ● Resources should leave with adequate time to avoid the loss of Escape Routes. ● Advise residents to leave and notify supervisors of any residents who choose to stay so that you can follow-up on their welfare after the fire front passes. ● As with Check and Go, Prep and Go is well suited for engine strike teams and task forces. PREP AND DEFEND Prep and Defend is a tactic used when a Safety Zone and TRA are present and adequate time exists to safely prepare a structure for defense prior to the arrival of the fire front: 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-20

## Page 175

● Structure Triage Category – Threatened Defensible ● An ideal multiple resource tactic especially common in neighborhoods where efforts may be coordinated over a wide area. A tactic used when it is possible for fire resources to stay when the fire front arrives. Fire behavior MUST be such that it is safe for firefighters to remain and engage the fire. ● Adequate Escape Routes to a Safety Zone must be identified. A Safety Zone or TRA must exist on site. ● Firefighters must be vigilant to sudden changes in the fire intensity and be prepared to move to the TRA or withdraw along the Escape Route to the Safety Zone. ● Adequate time must exist to safely prepare the structure for defense prior to the arrival of the fire front. FIRE FRONT FOLLOWING Fire Front Following is a follow-up tactic employed when Check and Go, Prep and Go, or Bump and Run tactics are initially used: ● A tactic used to come in behind the fire front. ● This action is taken when there is insufficient time to safely set up ahead of the fire, or the intensity of the fire would likely cause injury to personnel located in front of the fire. ● The goal of “Fire Front Following” is to search for victims, effect perimeter control, extinguish spot fires around structures, control hot spots and reduce ember production. BUMP AND RUN Bump and Run is a tactic where resources typically move ahead of the fire front in the spotting zone to extinguish spot fires and hot spots, and to defend as many structures as possible: 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-21

## Page 176

● Bump and Run may be effective in the early stages of an incident when the resource commitment is light and structure defense is the priority. ● Bump and Run may also be used on fast moving incidents when there are adequate resources available, but where an effort must be made to control or steer the head and shoulders of the fire to a desired end point. ● Perimeter control and structure defense preparation are secondary considerations with the Bump and Run tactic. ● Resources must remain mobile during Bump and Run and must constantly identify Escape Routes to Safety Zones and Temporary Refuge Areas as they move with the fire front. ● Bump and Run is a defensive tactic when the fire front impact in the WUI is imminent and there are not enough resources to effectively take perimeter control action. It is an offensive tactic when resources are steering the head of the fire to a desirable end point. ● The tactic is useful when terrain and fuels are suitable for mobile attack. ● Front line supervisors and Strike Team/Task Force Leaders must realize that Bump and Run places resources in front of the advancing fire front and that extreme caution should be exercised. ● Control lines in front of the fire should be identified and prepared with dozers and fire crews enabling the Bump and Run resources to direct the fire to logical end point. This is a frontal attack strategy and a Watch Out Situation. Control lines in front of the main fire must be reinforced with retardant drops, coordinated firing operations and engine support. ANCHOR AND HOLD Anchor and Hold is a tactic utilizing control lines and large water streams from fixed water supplies in an attempt to stop 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-22

## Page 177

fire spread. The goal is to extinguish structure fires, defend exposures, and reduce ember production: ● Anchor and Hold can be referred to as taking a stand to stop the progression of the fire. ● Anchor and Hold tactics are more effective in urban neighborhoods where the fire is spreading from house to house. ● Establishing an Anchor and Hold line requires considerable planning and effort and utilizes both fixed and mobile resources: ◦ Fixed engines should be spotted in safe areas where they can safely withstand any fire situation. ◦ Mobile engines or task forces can engage in individual structure defense actions or perimeter control and re- supply from fixed water source. ◦ Mobile engines should be prepared to re-deploy to other areas should the fire escape the Anchor and Hold line. ● Ground resources, such as engine crews and hand crews should staff hose lines and be prepared to extinguish hot spots, fire perimeter, and structures. ◦ Handcrew Strike Teams should be deployed to construct fire control lines wherever needed and conduct firing operations. TACTICAL PATROL Tactical Patrol is a tactic where the key element is mobility and continuous monitoring of an assigned area: ● Tactical Patrol can either be initiated: ◦ After the main fire front has passed and flames have subsided but when the threat to structures remains.  Patrol areas where the fire has been passed but the risk to structures remains from fire brands 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-23

## Page 178

smoldering in void spaces, on roofs, in rain gutters and stored material near buildings. ◦ In neighborhoods away from the interface where there is predicted to be significant ember cast and accumulated ornamental vegetation.  The goal is to patrol areas downwind of potential ember showers.  The tactic should be used to extinguish hot spots or secondary structure ignitions, and address safety issues such as power lines, weakened trees, and other hazards. ◦ Vigilance, situational awareness and active suppression actions are a must. 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-24

APPENDIX A: WUI FIRE MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES 1. The first priority for all-risk decisions is human survival, both firefighters and the public. 2. Incident containment strategies specifically address and integrate protection of defensible improved property and wildland values. 3. Direct defense of improved property is undertaken when it is safe to do so, where there is sufficient time and appropriate resources available, and when the action directly contributes to achieving the overall incident objectives. 4. The firefighter’s decision to accept direction to engage in structure defense actions is based on the determination that the property is defendable, and the risk to firefighters can be safely mitigated under the current or potential fire conditions. 5. A decision to delay or withdraw from structure defense operations is the appropriate course of action when made in consideration of firefighter safety, current or potential fire behavior, or lack of defensibility of the structure or groups of structures. 6. Firefighters at all levels are responsible for making risk decisions appropriate to their individual knowledge, experience, training, and situational awareness. 7. Every firefighter is responsible for awareness of the factors that affect their judgment and the decision-making process, including: a realistic perception of their own knowledge, skills, and abilities, the presence of life threat or structures, fire behavior, availability of resources, social/political pressures, mission focus, and personal distractions such as home, work, health, and fatigue. 8. An individual’s ability to assimilate all available factors affecting situational awareness is limited in a dynamic wildland and urban interface environment. Every firefighter is responsible to understand and recognize these limitations, and to decide, and act in preparation for the “worst case.” 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-25

9. It is the responsibility of every firefighter to participate in the flow of information with supervisors, subordinates and peers. Clear and concise communication is essential to overcome limitations in situational awareness. 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-26

## Page 185

APPENDIX D: TACTICAL ENGAGEMENT PROC. (P.A.C.E.) Structure defense firefighting in the WUI is inherently dangerous because it is primarily associated with indirect firefighting. An approaching fire is a dynamic event and subject to sudden changes that can be very difficult to anticipate. Structure defense should start with a determination of the exit strategy. Indirect firefighting safety mitigations depend on fire behavior forecasts made in advance of the fires arrival. Accurate fire behavior forecasts are difficult to make with absolute certainty and at the same time these forecasts are the crux for determining effective safety mitigations (Temporary Refuge Areas, Escape Routes, and Safety Zones). With firefighter safety hanging in the balance of accurate fire behavior estimates that cannot be assured, it is imperative that a multi-step safety plan be established to compensate for the uncertainties. Firefighters must anticipate the unexpected and build agility (Tactical Maneuver) into their plan with contingency planning . The lexicon for contingency planning is P.A.C.E: P rimary Plan [Offense] ● Is focused on firefighter safety ● Is focused on mission objectives ● Yields the most desirable results ● (Staffing hose lines to suppress the fire around a structure) A lternate Plan [Offense] ● A fall back plan that closely supports the Primary Plan ● The results may be less desirable but still supports the Primary Plan 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-31

## Page 186

● (Retreating into or behind the structure until fire intensity diminishes) C ontingency Plan [Defense] ● A plan totally focused on the firefighter’s safety ● Move to a Temporary Refuge Area (an area that provides short-term relief) or withdraw along the Escape Route ● Move into a Safety Zone E mergency Plan [Defense] ● A plan totally focused on individual survival ● When threatened by fire, firefighters should get into their fire shelter ALWAYS HAVE A DEPLOYMENT SITE IDENTIFIED Implement P.A.C.E. prior to engaging in any Structure Defense action: P – Primary A – Alternate C – Contingency E – Emergency 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-32

## Page 187

APPENDIX E: LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT (DRAW-D) As with military operations, there are FIVE Levels of Engagement in firefighting – DRAW-D. These actions apply to all aspects of wildland firefighting from the incident strategy to the individual line assignments and structure defense. They identify a thoughtful and mindful approach to choosing the appropriate tactical action. Use of DRAW-D as Levels of Engagement incorporates a “can do” attitude in every Level of Engagement and every Level of Engagement is equal in value to the overall effort as the other. D efend – Holding Actions, defending priority areas ● Defend the structures ● Hold and improve the line R einforce – Bring more resources to bear ● Add resources necessary to advance or defend A dvance – Anchor and Flank ● Direct or indirect attack ● Active burnout operations W ithdraw – Cease current activities until conditions modify ● Abandon an established position or constructed line in response to an increase in fire intensity. ● Not a stigma, but a decision to move away from a threat D elay – Wait until the situation has modified sufficiently to allow a different Level of Engagement ● Waiting for conditions to meet identified triggers necessary to advance or defend ● Not a lack of effort, but a conscious decision to maximize long-term effectiveness 2017 ICS 420-1 WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE 14-33

INTRODUCTION The Medical Branch structure is designed to provide the Incident Commander with a basic, expandable system to manage a large number of patients during an incident. If incident conditions warrant, Medical Groups may be established under the Medical Branch Director. The degree of implementation will depend upon the complexity of the incident. MODULAR DEVELOPMENT A series of examples for the modular development of the Medical Branch within an incident involving mass casualties is included to illustrate one possible method of expanding the incident organization: Initial Response Organization: The Incident Commander manages initial response resources as well as all Command and General Staff responsibilities. The Incident Commander assigns a resource with the appropriate communications capability as the Medical Communications Coordinator to establish communications with the appropriate hospital or other coordinating facility. In addition, the Incident Commander assigns a Triage Unit Leader, establishes treatment areas, and assigns a Ground Ambulance Coordinator. Reinforced Response Organization: In addition to the initial response, the Incident Commander establishes a Safety Officer, a Treatment Unit Leader, and a Patient Transportation Unit Leader. An Air Ambulance Coordinator is established based on the complexity of the air ambulance operation, and a Helispot Manager is established to manage the designated Helispot. Immediate, Delayed, and Minor Treatment Areas are established and staffed. Ambulance Strike Teams may be requested through the local EMS system to support local resources. 2017 ICS 420-1 MULTI CASUALTY 15-2

## Page 195

Multi-Division/Group Response Organization: All positions within the Medical Group are now filled. A Rescue Group is established to free entrapped victims. A Fire Suppression Group is established to control any hazardous conditions. A Medical Unit and Responder Rehabilitation are established to support incident personnel. Multi-Branch Response Organization: The complete incident organization shows the Medical Branch and other Branches. The Medical Branch has multiple Medical Groups due to incident complexity but only one Patient Transportation Group. This is because all patient transportation must be coordinated through one point to avoid overloading hospitals or other medical facilities. The Air Operations Branch is shown to illustrate the coordination between the Patient Transportation Unit and the Air Operations Branch. 2017 ICS 420-1 MULTI CASUALTY 15-3

INTRODUCTION The Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) organizational module is designed to provide supervision and control of essential functions at incidents where technical rescue expertise and equipment are required for safe and effective rescue operations. US&R operations are unique in that specialized training and equipment are required to mitigate the incident in the safest and most efficient manner possible. Initial US&R operations will be directed by the first arriving public safety officer who will assume command as the Incident Commander. Subsequent changes in the incident command structure will be based on the resource and management needs of the incident following established ICS procedures. Additional resources may include US&R Companies and US&R Crews or modular components of other US&R assets specifically trained and equipped for urban search and rescue operations. The US&R Company is capable of conducting search and rescue operations at incidents where technical expertise and equipment are required. US&R Crews are trained urban search and rescue personnel dispatched to the incident without rescue equipment. US&R Companies and Crews can be assigned as a single resource, grouped to form US&R Strike Teams, or added to other resources to form a Task Force. US&R Single Resources, Strike Teams, and Task Forces are managed the same as other incident resources. Due to the unique hazards and complexity of urban search and rescue incidents, the Incident Commander may need to request a wide variety and amount of multi-disciplinary resources. US&R Companies and Crews are "typed" based on an identified operational capability. Four levels of US&R operational capability have been identified to assist the Incident Commander in requesting appropriate resources for the incident. These levels are based on five general construction 2017 ICS 420-1 US&R US&R 16-2

## Page 215

categories and an increasing capability of conducting a rescue at specified emergency situations with an identified minimum amount of training and equipment. The US&R Type-4 Operational Level represents the minimum capability to conduct safe and effective search and rescue operations at incidents involving non-structural entrapment in non-collapsed structures. The US&R Type-3 Operational Level represents the minimum capability to conduct safe and effective search and rescue operations at structure collapse incidents involving the collapse or failure of Light Frame Construction and low angle or one- person load rope rescue. The US&R Type-2 Operational Level represents the minimum capability to conduct safe and effective search and rescue operations at structure collapse incidents involving the collapse or failure of Heavy Wall Construction, high angle rope rescue (not including highline systems), confined space rescue (no permit required), and trench and excavation rescue. The US&R Type-1 Operational Level represents the minimum capability to conduct safe and effective search and rescue operations at structure collapse incidents involving the collapse or failure of Heavy Floor, Pre-Cast Concrete, and Steel Frame Construction, high angle rope rescue (including highline systems), confined space rescue (permit required), and mass transportation rescue. The Regional US&R Task Force Level is comprised of 29 trained personnel equipped for large or complex US&R operations. The multi-disciplinary organization provides five functional elements that include Supervision, Search, Rescue, Medical, and Logistics. The Regional US&R Task Force is totally self-sufficient for the first 24 hours. Transportation and logistical support are provided by the sponsoring agency and may be supported by the requesting agency. 2017 ICS 420-1 US&R US&R 16-3

## Page 216

State/National US&R Task Force is comprised of 70 trained personnel when configured as a Type-1 Task Force equipped for large or complex US&R operations. As many as 10 additional ground support workers may be attached for ground transport. The multi-disciplinary organization provides seven functional elements that include Supervision, Search, Rescue, Haz Mat/WMD, Medical, Logistics, and Planning. The State/National US&R Task Force is designed to be used as a "single resource". However, each element of the Task Force is modularized into functional components and can be independently requested and utilized. The State/National US&R Task Force may also be configured as a Type-3 Task Force with 28 members. A State/National Type-3 US&R Task Force has the capabilities and communications to respond to light frame building collapse, basic rope rescue or operations, and trench and excavation rescues. Staffing includes personnel to address Haz Mat and ALS needs. MODULAR DEVELOPMENT US&R incidents may occur that will require rescue operations that exceed a resource's identified capability. When the magnitude or type of incident is not commensurate with a capability level, the Incident Commander will have the flexibility to conduct rescue operations in a safe and appropriate manner using existing resources within the scope of their training and equipment until adequate resources can be obtained or the incident is terminated. The flexibility and modular expansion capability of the Incident Command System provides various ways US&R resources can be arranged and managed. A series of modular development examples is included to illustrate several possible methods of expanding the incident organization based on existing emergency conditions, available resources, and incident objectives. 2017 ICS 420-1 US&R US&R 16-4

## Page 217

The ICS Modular Development examples shown are not meant to be restrictive, nor to imply these are the only ways to build an ICS organizational structure to manage US&R resources at an incident. To the contrary, the ICS Modular Development examples are provided only to show conceptually how one can arrange and manage resources at a US&R incident that builds from an initial response to a Multi-Branch organization: Initial Response Organization: The first arriving Public Safety Officer will assume command of the incident as the Incident Commander. The Incident Commander will assume all Command and General Staff functions and responsibilities and manage initial response resources. If the potential for escalation is low, then no specific ICS functional positions are established. If the incident requires an upgraded response, the Incident Commander should consider the early establishment of ICS positions. The following examples illustrate this modular growth of the ICS structure to keep pace with increased resource response. Reinforced Response Organization: In addition to the initial response, more Law Enforcement, local Engine and Truck Companies, and Mutual Aid resources have arrived. The Incident Commander forms a Unified Command with the senior ranking officials of other agencies having jurisdiction and has established a Safety Officer to assure personnel safety. A Public Information Officer has been assigned to manage the large media presence. An Operations Section has been assigned to manage the tactical assignments and responsibilities. A Staging Area is established to check in arriving resources. A US&R Group has been established to better coordinate the search and rescue efforts. Public Works is removing debris from the street to improve access and egress routes. 2017 ICS 420-1 US&R US&R 16-5

## Page 218

Multi-Division/Group Response Organization: The Incident Commander has added a Liaison Officer to the Command Staff to coordinate assisting agencies' and assigned a Planning and Logistics Section. One US&R Technical Specialist who understands the unique complexities and resource requirements at US&R incidents is assigned to the Planning Section. The Operations Section has established several Groups and Divisions to better coordinate the large volume of diverse resources at the incident. A Law Group and Medical Group have been formed. A Regional US&R Task Force, a State/National US&R Task Force, and a Structural Engineer Technical Specialist from the Planning Section have been assigned to the US&R Group. A Handcrew Strike Team is assisting with debris removal. Multi-Branch Response Organization: The Incident Commander has assigned a Finance/Administration Section. The Operations Section has established five Branches with similar functions to better coordinate and manage resources. The Planning, Logistics, and Finance/Administration Sections have several Units operational to support the large amount of resources at the incident. 2017 ICS 420-1 US&R US&R 16-6

US&R SEARCH TYPES Reconnaissance Search – Recon is the preliminary survey for the purpose of determining the scope and magnitude of the incident and identifying the resources needed to manage the incident. Other considerations for Recon include: ● Initial visual check of damaged area and/or assigned area of operation. ● May be conducted on foot, by vehicle, by watercraft, or by air. ● For isolated structure collapse incidents, the primary purpose of this action is structural assessment and hazardous materials assessment. ● Known locations of live or deceased victims will be recorded, and appropriate rescue or recovery resources will be requested. ● Size and makeup of recon teams are incident-driven and flexible. ● Recon teams should not engage in rescue operations. ● Timely reporting of recon information is critical to the health and safety of responders, survivability of victims, and effective management of the incident. Rapid Search (Hasty Search) – Rapid Search is a fast-paced and methodical search in an attempt to locate victims that are in immediate need of rescue. Other considerations for Rapid Search include: ● May be conducted on foot, by vehicle, by watercraft, or by air. ● Size and makeup of Rapid Search teams are incident- driven and flexible. ● If live victims are located and can be easily evacuated, they will be immediately removed and moved to the identified casualty collection point. 2017 ICS 420-1 US&R US&R 16-25

## Page 238

● Known locations of live or deceased victims will be recorded, and appropriate rescue or recovery resources will be requested. ● Documentation of areas searched must be recorded and reported. ● Rapid Search may be accomplished simultaneously with Recon. Primary Search – Primary Search is a quick search of structures likely to contain survivors. Primary searches are ground or waterborne operations conducted by walking or boating around every structure looking for victims. This is accomplished by looking into every window/opening, knocking on doors, and hailing for live victims. If there are signs of victims (dead or alive), appropriate action will be taken based on the incident objectives. Other considerations for Primary Search are: ● Fast-paced, quick scan of surface debris in and around structures and selected voids. ● Size and makeup of the search team is incident-driven and flexible. ● Detection resources may include physical, canine, and technical. ● Known locations of live or deceased victims will be recorded, and appropriate rescue or recovery resources will be requested. ● Actions necessary to immediately correct life-threatening injuries may be performed by this team. ● Searched structures will be marked utilizing the Search Marking System (page 16-34 to page 16-39). ● Victim locations will be marked utilizing the Victim Marking System (page 16-40). 2017 ICS 420-1 US&R US&R 16-26

## Page 239

Secondary Search – Secondary Search is the systematic search of every room of every structure in the assigned area of operation. Forced entry of structures may need to occur in order to accomplish this objective but will only be done with the authority of the Incident Commander. This may involve extensive debris removal of building materials depending on the desired level of coverage and thoroughness: ● Slow and methodical search of structures, debris, and voids. ● Size and makeup of the search team is incident-driven and flexible. ● Detection resources may include physical, canine, and technical. ● Known locations of live or deceased victims will be recorded, and appropriate rescue or recovery resources will be requested. ● Actions necessary to immediately correct life-threatening injuries may be performed by this team. ● Searched structures will be marked utilizing the Search Marking System (Pages 16-26 through 16-28). ● Victim locations will be marked utilizing the Victim Marking System (Page 16-29). Special Response Search – SRS is a search implemented to gather information regarding the need for evacuation or rescue of pre-identified special needs populations. SRS may be conducted pre- or post- incident at these pre-identified locations. Search Modes DETECTION MODE – A search mode to determine if victims are present. LOCATION MODE – Following detection, a search mode to confirm victim's location and pinpoint for rescue. 2017 ICS 420-1 US&R US&R 16-27

REGIONAL US&R TASK FORCE (RTF) The Regional US&R Task Force Level is comprised of 29 people specially trained and equipped for large or complex US&R Operations. The multi-disciplinary organization provides five functional elements that include Supervision, Search, Rescue, Medical, and Tool/Equipment Support. The Regional US&R Task Force is totally self-sufficient for the first 24 hours. Transportation is provided by the sponsoring agency, and logistical support will normally be provided by the requesting agency. A Task Force Leader supervises the Regional US&R Task Force. An Assistant Safety Officer is attached to the Task Force, and upon arrival at the incident, will be supervised by the incident’s Safety Officer. The Assistant Safety Officer will work directly with the Task Force Leader and will be assigned to the RTF’s area of operation. The RTF Search element includes Canine and Technical Search capabilities. The RTF Rescue element includes a Type 1 US&R Company (personnel and equipment), a Type 1 US&R Crew (personnel), and a Heavy Equipment and Rigging Specialist. This element can conduct rescue operations in all types of structures. The RTF Medical element is responsible for the care and treatment of injured Task Force members or victims if such care must occur in the hazard area. The Medical element will work directly for the RTF and/or as appropriate within the Incident Medical Unit. The Tool and Equipment support element works within the Task Force for tool and equipment repair and maintenance, and will coordinate with the Incident Logistics Section for acquisition of tools, materials, and equipment from off-incident locations. 2017 ICS 420-1 US&R US&R 16-29

STATE/NATIONAL US&R TASK FORCE The Federal Government, through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has established several State/ National Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) Task Forces throughout the nation. All US&R Task Force activities are coordinated through the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (OES), which serves as the primary point of contact for FEMA/DHS. A US&R Task Force is also a State resource that can be acquired without a request for Federal assistance. All requests for a US&R Task Force must go through normal Mutual Aid request procedures. A full, 70-person, Type I, National US&R Task Force is able to deploy within six hours of activation. State/National US&R Task Force is comprised of 70 trained personnel when configured as a Type-1 Task Force equipped for large or complex US&R operations. As many as 10 additional ground support workers may be attached for ground transport. The multi-disciplinary organization provides seven functional elements that include Supervision, Search, Rescue, Haz Mat/WMD, Medical, Logistics, and Planning. The State/National US&R Task Force is designed to be used as a "single resource". However, each element of the Task Force is modularized into functional components and can be independently requested and utilized. The State/National US&R Task Force may also be configured as a Type-3 Task Force with 28 members. A State/National Type-3 US&R Task Force has the capabilities and communications to respond to light frame building collapse, basic rope rescue or operations, and trench and excavation rescues. Staffing includes personnel to address Haz Mat and ALS needs. A Task Force Leader supervises the State/National US&R Task Force. The US&R Task Force Search element includes physical, canine, and electronic capabilities. The Rescue 2017 ICS 420-1 US&R US&R 16-31

element can conduct rescue operations in all types of structures. The Haz Mat element is primarily responsible for the detection and decontamination of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE) substances for Task Force members and entrapped victims. The Medical element is primarily responsible for the care and treatment of Task Force members and entrapped victims during extrication. The Logistics element provides the Task Force with logistical support and communications. The Planning element provides personnel competent in structural integrity assessments and documentation of Task Force activities. The State/National US&R Task Force is designed to be used as a Single Resource but is modularized into functional elements that can be independently requested and utilized. However, once mobilized as a State/National US&R Task Force, the elements shall remain under the supervision of the US&R Task Force Leader. A Federal US&R Incident Support Team (IST) coordinates the arrival of a State/National US&R Task Force. The IST is capable of providing overhead management and logistical support to the US&R Task Force while on deployment if an ICS organization is not in place. If an ICS organization is in place, the IST will integrate into that organization. State/National US&R Task Forces will work within the local incident command organization. 2017 ICS 420-1 US&R US&R 16-32

STRUCTURE/HAZARDS MARKING SYSTEM At incidents involving several structures or large areas of damage, the identity and location of individual structures is crucial. The use of existing street names and addresses should always be considered first. If due to damage this is not possible, use the existing hundred block and place all even numbers on one side of the street and all odd numbers on the other side. Mark the new numbers on the front of the structure with orange spray paint. If due to damage the name of the street is not identifiable, start with the letter “A” using the phonetic alphabet “Alpha”, “Bravo”, "Charlie", etc. Structure hazards identified during initial size-up activities and throughout the incident should be noted. This Structure/ Hazards Mark should be made on the outside of all normal entry points. Orange spray paint seems to be the most easily seen color on most backgrounds, and line marking or downward spray cans apply the best paint marks. Lumber chalk or lumber crayons should be used to mark additional information inside the search mark itself because they are easier to write with than spray paint. A large square box (approximately two feet) is outlined at any entrance accessible for entry into any compromised structure. Use orange paint for this marking. Specific markings will be clearly made adjacent to the box to indicate the condition of the structure and any hazards found at the time of this assessment. Normally, the square box marking would be made immediately adjacent to the entry point identified as safe. An arrow will be placed next to the box indicating the direction of the safe entrance if the Structure/Hazards marking must be made somewhat remote from the safe entrance. 2017 ICS 420-1 US&R US&R 16-34

## Page 247

Make a large (2' x 2') square box with orange spray paint on the outside of the main entrance to the structure. Put the date, time, haz - ardous material conditions, and team or company identifier outside the box on the right-hand side. This information can be made with a lumber-marking device. 9/12/93 1310 hrs. HM – nat. gas SMA – E-1 Structure is accessible and safe for search and rescue operations. Damage is minor with little danger of further collapse. 9/12/93 1310 hrs. HM – None SMA – E-1 Structure is significantly damaged. Some areas are relatively safe, but other areas may need shoring, bracing, or removal of falling and collapsed hazards. 9/12/93 1310 hrs. HM – nat. gas SMA – E-1 Structure is not safe for search or rescue operations. May be subject to sudden additional collapse. Remote search operations may proceed at significant risk. If rescue operations are undertaken, safe haven areas and rapid evacuation routes should be created. 9/12/93 1310 hrs. HM – nat. gas SMA – E-1 Arrow located next to a marking box indicates the direction to a safe entrance into the structure should the marking box need to be made remote from the indicated entrance. STRUCTURE/HAZARDS MARKINGS 2017 ICS 420-1 US&R US&R 16-35

## Page 248

SEARCH MARKING SYSTEM Search Markings must be easy to make, easy to read, and easy to understand. To be easily seen, the search mark must be large and of a contrasting color to the background surface. Orange spray paint seems to be the most easily seen color on most backgrounds, and line marking or downward spray cans apply the best paint marks. A lumber marking device may be used to write additional information inside the search mark itself when it is difficult to write the additional information with spray paint. A large distinct marking will be made outside the main entrance of each building, structure, or area to be searched. This “Main Entrance” search marking will be completed in two steps. First, a large, single slash (approximately two feet) shall be made starting at the upper left and moving to the lower right near the main entrance at the start of the search. The Search Team identifier and time that the structure was entered shall be marked to the left of the mid-point of the slash, and the date shall be marked near the top of the slash on the opposite side. When the search of the entire structure is complete and the Search Team exits the building, a second large slash shall be made in the opposite direction forming an “X” on the Main Entrance search marking. Additional information summarizing the entire search of the structure will be placed in three quadrants of the “X”. The left quadrant will already contain the Search Team identifier and time when the Search Team first entered the structure. In the top quadrant, enter the time the Search Team exited the structure under the date. Change the date if different from date the structure was entered. The right quadrant is for any significant hazards located inside the structure. The bottom quadrant is for the number of live “V” or dead “ V ” victims still inside the structure. Use a small “X” in the bottom quadrant if no victims are inside the structure. 2017 ICS 420-1 US&R US&R 16-36

## Page 249

If the search of the entire structure is incomplete, make a circle (approximately 1’ diameter) in the middle of the single slash. The left side will already contain the Search Team identifier and time when the Search Team first entered the structure. At the top end of the slash, enter the time the Search Team exited the structure under the date. Change the date if different from date the structure was entered. On the right side, the mid-point of the slash is for any significant hazards located inside the structure. The bottom end of the slash is for the number of live “V” or dead “ V ” victims still inside the structure. Use a small “X” at the bottom if no victims are inside the structure. During the search function, while inside the structure, a large single slash shall be made upon entry of each room, area, or floor. After the search of the room or area has been completed, a second large slash shall be drawn in the opposite direction forming an “X”. The only additional information placed in any of the “X” quadrants while inside the structure shall be that pertaining to any significant hazards and the number of live “V” or dead “ V ” victims, as indicated by “V” for live and “ V ” for dead. 2017 ICS 420-1 US&R US&R 16-37

Make a large (2' x 2') "V" with orange spray paint near the location of a potential victim. Mark the name of the Search Team or crew identifier in the top part of the "V" with paint or a limber marker type device. Paint a circle around the "V" when a potential victim is confirmed to be alive either visually, vocally, or hearing spe - cific sounds that would indicate a high probability of a live victim. If more than one confirmed live victim, mark the total number of victims under the "V". Paint a horizontal line through the middle "V" when a confirmed victim is determined to be deceased . If more that one confirmed deceased victim, mark the total number of victims under the "V". Use both the live and deceased victim- marking symbols when a combination of live and deceased victims is determined to be in the same location. Paint an "X" through the confirmed victim symbol after all victim(s) have been removed from the specific location identified by the marking. An arrow may need to be painted next to the "V" pointing towards the victim when the victim's location is not immediately near where the "V" is painted.

EMERGENCY SIGNALING SYSTEM Because of the high potential of secondary collapse, dangerous conditions, and the need to communicate other important information, an emergency signaling system should be adopted and in use by all personnel at the incident site. Emergency signals must be loud, identifiable, and sounded when conditions require immediate attention. Emergency signals can be made using devices such as a whistle, air horn, vehicle horn, or bell. Each structure or larger area of operations may need to have its own distinct emergency signal device when multiple rescue operations are taking place in the same area to reduce confusion. Supervisors should identify and inform assigned personnel of a designated place of assembly and/or Safe Zone for a Personal Accountability Report (PAR) to be conducted should an evacuation signal be sounded. A place of assembly is usually a safe location outside the evacuation area. A Safe Zone is usually a safe location within a building or disaster site that can be entered within the evacuation area. When an evacuation signal is sounded, all supervisors must conduct a roll call of their assigned personnel and communicate the results of the PAR to their supervisor. Evacuate The Area Short signals repeated for 10 seconds, pause for 10 seconds, and repeat for 3 repetitions. Total signal time – 50 seconds. Cease Operations/All Quiet One long signal (8 to 10 seconds). Resume Operations One long and one short signal. 2017 ICS 420-1 US&R US&R 16-42

INTRODUCTION The Hazardous Materials organizational module is designed to provide an organizational structure that will provide necessary supervision and control for the essential functions required at virtually all Hazardous Materials incidents. This is based on the premise that controlling the tactical operations of companies and movement of personnel and equipment will provide a greater degree of safety and also reduce the probability of spreading of contaminants. The Hazardous Materials Group Supervisor or the Hazardous Materials Branch Director (if activated) will direct primary functions and all resources that have a direct involvement with hazardous materials operations. MODULAR DEVELOPMENT A series of examples of modular development is included to illustrate one method of expanding the incident organization: Initial Response Organization: The Incident Commander manages all initial response resources as well as all Command and General Staff responsibilities. Reinforced Response Organization: In addition to the initial response, the responsible agencies have met and established a Unified Command. They have established a Hazardous Materials Group to manage all activities within the Control Zones and have organized a Law Enforcement Group to isolate and contain the operational area. The Unified Command has established a Planning Section, a Staging Area, and an Assistant Safety Officer – Hazardous Materials. A Medical Unit has been established for incident personnel support and responder rehabilitation. Multi-Division/Group Response Organization: The Incident Commanders have activated most Command and General Staff positions and have established multiple groups. 2017 ICS 420-1 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS MASS DECONTAMINATION 17-2

INTRODUCTION The Terrorism/Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Section will provide an organizational structure designed to provide the necessary supervision, coordination, management, and control of a complex, escalating, and multi-discipline event. The purpose of this guide is to identify the key organizational positions that will best coordinate the various agencies involved within a Unified Command. Unique hazards will be presented in Terrorism/WMD events that include intentional acts and attacks that may occur in stages or waves at several locations at the same time. Early recognition and requests for specialized resources are vital to the successful management and mitigation of the incident while ensuring responder safety. Type 1 Hazardous Materials Teams are trained and equipped to respond to a Terrorism/ WMD incident. Responsibilities of scene security, hazardous device disposal, investigation, and crowd/traffic control will be assessed and handled by the appropriate Units/Groups. UNIFIED COMMAND Unified Command shall be implemented at all Terrorism/WMD incidents when multiple agencies or jurisdictions with statutory or political authority and financial responsibilities are involved. Unified Commanders shall be co-located. A single Command Post is the best method to ensure effective communications, coordination of resources, and overall operational management of the incident(s). 2017 ICS 420-1 TERRORISM WMD 18-2

## Page 287

MODULAR DEVELOPMENT The flexibility and modular expansion design of the Incident Command System provides a number of ways that public safety and contract resources can be arranged and managed. A series of modular development examples is included to illustrate several possible methods of expanding the incident organization based on existing emergency conditions, available resources, and incident objectives. The ICS Modular Development examples shown are not meant to be restrictive, nor to imply these are the only ways to build an ICS organizational structure to manage resources at a Terrorism/WMD incident. To the contrary, the ICS Modular Development examples are provided only to show conceptually how one can arrange and manage resources at the incident that builds from an initial response to a multi-branch organization: Initial Response Organization: The first arriving Public Safety Officer initiates immediate actions to isolate, contain, and deny entry. The Public Safety Officer has assumed Incident Command and has requested the agency(s) having jurisdiction to respond and establish Unified Command. The Incident Commander manages all initial response resources as well as all Command and General Staff responsibilities. Reinforced Response Organization: In addition to the initial response, the responsible agencies have met and established Unified Command. They have established a Hazardous Materials Group to manage all activities within the Control Zones and have organized Law Enforcement units into a Law Enforcement Group to isolate and contain the operational area. Unified Command has established a Planning Section, a Staging Area, and a Safety Officer. 2017 ICS 420-1 TERRORISM WMD 18-3

## Page 288

Multi-Division/Group Response Organization: The Incident Commanders have activated most Command and General Staff positions and have established a combination of divisions and multiple groups. Based on the incident needs, the intelligence function may be activated as a fifth section, as an element within the Operations or Planning Sections, or as part of the Command Staff. Multi-Branch Response Organization: The Unified Command is joined by additional responsible agencies as the incident grows. As the incident becomes more complex, the Unified Command creates a Law Enforcement Branch and potentially a US&R Branch to address the risks of the incident. The Operations Section Chief and a Deputy Operations Section Chief may switch roles based upon the current objectives of the incident as well as the individual’s discipline (e.g., Law Enforcement, Fire, EMS). 2017 ICS 420-1 TERRORISM WMD 18-4

INTRODUCTION Local and widespread swiftwater and flood emergencies can strain local resources creating a need for mutual aid resources. This chapter focuses on the development and identification of specific Swiftwater/Flood Search and Rescue (SF/S&R) resources. This chapter is intended to provide guidance and develop recommendations for SF/S&R resources. This includes but is not limited to: ● Organizational Development ● Resource Typing ● Training and Equipment ● Procedures and Guidelines for Incident Operations It is the responsibility of agencies responding to Mutual Aid, SF/S&R requests to provide qualified personnel and equipment that meet or exceed the recommended level of skills and capabilities stipulated in this document. The recommended training, skills, and equipment lists are contained in the Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan (SAR) Annex and the FIRESCOPE Document, ICS-SF-SAR 020-1. 2017 ICS 420-1 SWIFTWATER/FLOOD SEARCH AND RESCUE 19-2

## Page 305

INITIAL RESPONSE The first arriving Public Safety Officer will direct initial Swiftwater/Flood Search and Rescue (SF/S&R) operations. This officer will assume initial command of the operation as the Incident Commander. Subsequent changes in the incident command structure will be based on the needs of the incident with consideration of jurisdictional responsibilities, established agreements, and state and local statutes and shall be accomplished by following established ICS procedures. Additional resources specifically trained and equipped for SF/S&R operations may be required. These SF/S&R resources may be assigned as a single resource or grouped together to form Task Forces. Due to the unique hazards and complexity of SF/S&R incidents, the Incident Commander may require a variety of different multi-disciplinary resources to accomplish the SF/S&R mission. (see APPENDIX E: ADDITIONAL SF/S&R RESOURCES PAGE 19-13 ) SF/S&R resources have been categorized or “typed.” (see APPENDIX A: SF/S&R RESOURCE TYPING PAGE 19-9 and APPENDIX B: FLOOD EVACUATION BOAT TYPING PAGE 19-10 ) Typing reflects identified operational capabilities based on specialized training, skills, and equipment (ICS SF/SAR 020-1). This typing is based on team qualifications, available equipment, and training, as needed for safe and efficient rescue operations for identified SF/S&R tasks. SF/S&R incidents may occur that will require rescue operations that exceed on-scene personnel capabilities. When the magnitude or type of incident exceeds that capability level, the Incident Commander will have the flexibility to conduct search and rescue operations in a safe and appropriate manner until adequate resources can be obtained or the incident is terminated. 2017 ICS 420-1 SWIFTWATER/FLOOD SEARCH AND RESCUE 19-3

## Page 306

UNIFIED COMMAND A Unified Command should be implemented at SF/S&R incidents when multiple agencies or jurisdictions with statutory or political authority and financial responsibility are involved. Incident Commanders involved in a Unified Command shall be co-located. A single Command Post is the best method to ensure effective communications, coordination of resources, and overall operational management of the incident. MODULAR DEVELOPMENT The flexibility and modular expansion design of the Incident Command System provides an almost infinite number of ways SF/S&R resources can be arranged and managed. Refer to the Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations or the FIRESCOPE Field Operations Guide (ICS-420-1). 2017 ICS 420-1 SWIFTWATER/FLOOD SEARCH AND RESCUE 19-4

SF/S&R REC. TRAINING, SKILLS, AND EQUIPMENT LIST (ICS-SF-SAR 020-1) SF/S&R DECONTAMINATION Decontamination of Equipment and Personnel: The following are the recommended decontamination procedures for resources assigned to SF/S&R operations. Any resources exposed to floodwaters during their operations should complete the appropriate level of decontamination. Consult with qualified Hazardous Materials personnel when available. Basic Decontamination: Personnel : After completing assignments in floodwaters, hands and face should be washed with clean water and soap. All members should be required to wash hands before entering vehicles and eating areas. Handwashing is essential to reduce secondary contamination. Equipment : When the team’s operational assignment is completed, equipment should be rinsed with clean water. Visible contaminates, mud and light oils, should be removed with soap. Level 1 Decontamination: Level 1 decontamination procedures should be used in areas where there is potential for exposure to general contaminates, and the water is standing or moving slowly. Examples of areas where the use of this level of decon is needed would be residential and agricultural areas where there is no evidence of large releases of hazardous materials. Personnel : After completing assignment in floodwaters, hands and face should be washed with clean water and anti- 2017 ICS 420-1 SWIFTWATER/FLOOD SEARCH AND RESCUE 19-18

## Page 321

microbial soap. All members should wash their hands before entering vehicles and eating areas. On completion of the day’s operations, all members exposed to suspected or known contaminated water should shower and change into clean clothes. Equipment : When the team’s operational assignment is completed, equipment should be washed with soap and clean water. This decon should be completed as soon as possible following the operations. Dry suits should also be washed before entering vehicles for trips from one work site to another. Level 2 Decontamination: Level 2 decontamination procedures should be used any time hazardous materials are identified or likely to be present. These include areas of sewage contamination as well as agricultural and chemical contamination. These areas should not be entered, if possible. Limiting the number of personnel exposed to the water should be the top priority of the Team Leader. Support for decontamination should be arranged before units are committed to the contaminated area. Water samples should be taken for testing from areas entered by the team. The Medical Unit should be notified if any personnel require this level of decontamination. All personnel exposed to the contaminates should have a one-hour, twelve-hour, and twenty-four hour medical check following their exposure. Personnel : After exiting the water, even for short periods during the operational period, members should go through a scrub gross decon* wash with soap and clean water. Remove gloves and wash hands and face with clean water and anti- microbial soap. At the end of the duty period, members should go through a gross decon scrub wash with soap and clean water before any safety gear is removed. Wash hands and face with clean water and anti-microbial soap after removing all safety gear. Shower using anti-microbial soap before leaving 2017 ICS 420-1 SWIFTWATER/FLOOD SEARCH AND RESCUE 19-19

the scene if possible, or as soon as possible thereafter, and change into clean clothes. Equipment : All equipment should be sprayed with bleach solution** or other agents as recommended by on-scene Hazardous Materials personnel and allowed to stand a minimum of fifteen minutes. Thoroughly rinse all treated equipment with clean water and allow to dry before storing with other equipment. Bag any equipment that cannot be dried for the return trip to the base. Wipe with bleach solution** any surfaces inside vehicles that might have come in contact with wet safety equipment during the duty period. Units requiring Level 2 Decontamination should be taken out of service until all equipment has been cleaned and dried. *Gross Decon Wash: This is a two-stage process that is set up along a decontamination corridor. All run-off solutions are retained for proper disposal. Persons implementing the corridor should be protected by splash gear. It is recommended that qualified Hazardous Materials personnel be requested to implement this procedure. Stage 1: Rescuer in safety gear is scrubbed with brushes using a clean water and soap solution. Any contaminated tools are left behind here for cleaning. Stage 2: Rescuer is rinsed with clean water. **Bleach Solution: Bleach solution should be made using two tbsp.

INTRODUCTION The High Rise module describes an all-hazard organization designed to provide effective management and control of essential functions at incidents occurring in large, multi- story buildings. These incidents may present significant management, logistical, and safety challenges to emergency personnel. The size and complexity of the interior spaces, limited and arduous access, extended travel and response times, and the concentrated occupant load with egress challenges all contribute to the problems faced by emergency responders. Additionally, most high rise structures are equipped with various environmental, fire protection, and life safety systems that require support and control. Successful emergency operations in these types of buildings also require preplanning and technical competence on the part of emergency responders. MODULAR DEVELOPMENT The order in which the Incident Command System (ICS) organizational structure develops may vary with the type and scope of the incident. Following are examples of modular development of the ICS that serve to illustrate typical methods of expanding the management organization at a high rise incident. These examples reflect the size and complexity of the incident and the available resources at a given time in the incident: Initial Response Organization: The Incident Commander manages the initial response resources as well as all Command and General Staff responsibilities. 2017 ICS 420-1 HIGH RISE 20-2

## Page 325

Multi-Division/Group Response Organization: The Incident Commander has established most Command and General Staff positions and has established a combination of divisions and groups to reflect the location and nature of the incident. Multi-Branch Response Organization: The Incident Commander has identified a number of actual or potential incident challenges and has established all Command and General Staff positions. The Incident Commander has also established several branches to effectively manage the problems and the resources required for mitigation. 2017 ICS 420-1 HIGH RISE 20-3

Consider establishing a Law Branch. The Planning Section has expanded to include the Resources Unit and Situation Unit. Logistics Section has activated the Support and Service Branches as well as various Units within each Branch to accommodate the extensive logistical requirements for this size incident. 2017 ICS 420-1 HIGH RISE 20-6

## Page 329

DESIGNATED INCIDENT FACILITIES Base and Staging have modified functions and locations in high rise incidents: Staging Area : The challenging nature of high rise incidents requires modification to the standard ICS concept of a Staging Area. The limited access and vertical travel distance of large high rise buildings require establishment of a resource Staging Area within the building. The high rise Staging Area must also serve multiple functions. The Staging Area is generally located a minimum of two floors below the emergency, as long as the atmosphere is tenable. The specific changes are described in the Staging Area Manager’s Position Description. Base : The Base at a high rise incident resembles a ground- level Staging Area. The main difference between Base and a typical Staging Area is that Base must be expanded to perform the functions inherent to supporting large numbers of personnel and equipment. Base should be located away from the incident building to provide for the safety of personnel and equipment. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS Certain existing ICS positions and functional units within the high rise incident organization have modified responsibilities that require full descriptions. These positions include Staging Area Manager, Rapid Intervention Group Supervisor, Base Manager, Ground Support Unit Leader, and Evacuation Group Supervisor. Specialized High Rise ICS Positions : Lobby Control Unit Leader, Systems Control Unit Leader, and Rapid Ascent Team Leader are specialized functional positions specific to a high rise incident. 2017 ICS 420-1 HIGH RISE 20-7

## Page 330

Lobby Control Unit is established to provide access control, accountability, and routing inside the building. During the initial period of an incident, or in a less complex building, the Lobby Control Unit may assume the functions of the Systems Control Unit as shown in the basic organization chart. As the incident escalates, a separate Systems Control Unit may be established to operate, supervise, and coordinate the vital operation of specialized systems incorporated into modern high rise buildings. These systems may include electrical supply and smoke removal systems. Systems Control Unit coordinates the efforts of various Technical Specialists who might be required to assist in the operation and/or repair of the various systems. The High Rise Rapid Ascent Team Leader is responsible for directing and/or relocating the building occupants and casualties through the evacuation stairwell(s) to refuge area(s). The positions and modifications are described in the position checklists that follow. The major responsibilities and procedures for each are further explained in the position manuals. 2017 ICS 420-1 HIGH RISE 20-8

PROTECTIVE ACTION GUIDELINES INTRODUCTION This section provides guidelines and procedures for protective actions when hazardous conditions develop to the degree that emergency responders must take action to protect the public at risk. Threatened or hazardous areas may be created by, but are not limited to fires, hazardous materials, transportation accidents, floods, WMD incidents, civil disturbances, etc. Ideally, protective actions are progressive, usually initiated by alerting the public in the affected area, controlling access, sheltering in-place, and finally by evacuation. However, these actions may be implemented simultaneously based on the hazard, complexity of the emergency, and the type and size of the affected area. The key to successfully conducting protective action operations is sound planning. AUTHORITY The decision to alert the public of a hazardous incident, restricted or closed access corridors, and/or to evacuate an affected area is often made by the fire department Incident Commander. However, the authority necessary to carry out these actions usually rests with law enforcement. For example, the California Penal Code 409.5 provides law enforcement and health officers the legal authority to “close and/or evacuate” an area. Other state, county, or city jurisdictions may vary. California 409.5 P.C. states: a. “Whenever a menace to the public health or safety is created by a calamity such as flood, storm, fire, earthquake, explosion, accident, or other disasters, police officers, lifeguards, publicly employed full-time marine safety officers or local health officers may close the area where the menace exists for the duration thereof by 2017 ICS 420-1 PROTECTIVE GUIDELINES 21-2

## Page 341

means of ropes, markers or guards to any and all persons not authorized by the lifeguard or officers to enter or remain within the enclosed area.” b. “Law enforcement may close the immediate area surrounding any emergency field command post activated for the purpose of abating any calamity enumerated in this section or any riot or other civil disturbance to any and all unauthorized persons pursuant to the conditions which are set forth in this section whether or not the field command post or other command post is located near to the actual calamity or riot or other civil disturbance.” c. “Any unauthorized person who willfully and knowingly enters an area closed pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) and who willfully remains within the area after receiving notice to evacuate or leave shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.” d. “Nothing in this section shall prevent a duly authorized representative of any news service, newspaper, or radio or television station or network from entering the areas closed pursuant to this section.” Simply stated, whenever law enforcement/health officials feel that an area must be closed and/or evacuated to protect the public, 409.5 P.C. provides the legal authority to do so. If residents refuse to comply, that refusal should be noted and the Incident Commander advised of a non-compliance of the evacuation order. 2017 ICS 420-1 PROTECTIVE GUIDELINES 21-3

## Page 342

ORGANIZATION In emergency operations, there may be several lead and support agencies involved. In an incident where one agency has a preponderance of responsibility for abating the problem, a single Incident Commander from that agency shall be appointed. On an incident where law enforcement and the fire department both have substantial responsibilities, a Unified Command organizational structure should be formed. Establishing a Unified Incident Command structure better integrates incident objectives, and the development of Incident Action Plans. This results in a more efficient coordination process of incident operations thereby enhancing the safety of responders and the public. Incident Commanders should consider establishing an organizational element to manage evacuation planning and implementation. For extensive, complex evacuations, an Evacuation Branch may be established. For less complex actions, an Evacuation Group may be more appropriate. Staffing of the Evacuation Branch or Group should be unified to ensure coordination of actions. Re-entry and planning implementation can be accomplished with a similar organizations structure to safely facilitate managing requirements prior to and during the re-entry of evacuees. INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND NOTIFICATIONS a. Identify the hazard and risk to the public; determine the immediately affected area. b. Identify the next potentially affected areas, and plot them on a map utilizing an alpha-numeric grid system. Many commercially available map books utilize a .5 mile wide grid. This style map can be quickly utilized to plot an affected area. 2017 ICS 420-1 PROTECTIVE GUIDELINES 21-4

## Page 343

c. Ensure that the jurisdictional law enforcement agency is notified of the emergency situation, and recommend protective action(s). d. Ensure the appropriate cooperating and/or assisting agencies are notified with regard to recommended protective action(s). If evacuations are planned, ensure that evacuation centers are identified in safe areas. Note: The management of Evacuation Centers is often delegated to the local Red Cross or other non-government organizations (NGOs). PROTECTIVE ACTION TERMS a. Evacuation Warning – The alerting of people in an affected area(s) of potential threat to life and property. An Evacuation Warning considers the probability that an area will be affected within a given time frame and prepares people for a potential evacuation order. Evacuation Warnings are particularly necessary when dealing with a variety of issues such as special needs populations and large animals. b. Evacuation Order – Requires the immediate movement of people out of an affected area due to an imminent threat to life. c. Shelter-In-Place – Advises people to stay secure at their current location. This tactic shall only be used if evacuation will cause a higher potential for loss of life. Consideration should be given to assigning incident personnel to monitor the safety of citizens remaining in place. The concept of Shelter-in-Place is an available option in those instances where physical evacuation is impractical. This procedure may be effective for residential dwellings in the immediately impacted areas, or for large facilities that house a high percentage of non-ambulatory persons (e.g., hospitals and convalescent homes). Sheltering- in-Place attempts to provide a safe haven within the impacted area. 2017 ICS 420-1 PROTECTIVE GUIDELINES 21-5

## Page 344

When using structures, this involves closing all doors and windows, shutting off outside air supply to the facility, and waiting for the hazard to pass. Although the decision to Shelter-in-Place ultimately rests with the Incident Commander, situations may arise where incident personnel must take immediate action to protect civilians. d. Rescue – Emergency actions taken within the affected area to recover and remove injured or trapped citizens. Responders have specific training and personal protective equipment necessary to accomplish the mission (e.g., hazardous material spill, swiftwater rescue). Boundaries of the areas where rescue is planned should be identified on the incident map with notation that entry is restricted to rescue workers only. e. Community Refuge Area – A designated location that is considered to provide a greater level of survivability than Shelter-in-Place. If unable to make it to a designated Evacuation Shelter, civilians should be directed to seek shelter at a Community Refuge Area. Note: Depending on the size, type, and complexity of the emergency, all of the above protection actions could be employed on the same incident. 2017 ICS 420-1 PROTECTIVE GUIDELINES 21-6

## Page 345

EVACUATION CHECKLIST a. Establish and co-locate the Incident Command Post in a safe location with the capacity to include all cooperating agencies (e.g., law enforcement, fire, health department, local emergency management agency, to include any NGOs). b. Establish Unified Command when appropriate. Unified Incident Commanders should jointly assess and report incident potential and request adequate resources to accomplish agreed-upon objectives. c. Consider establishing an Evacuation Branch or Group, as appropriate and depending on complexity, to plan and implement evacuation actions and/or re-entry of evacuees. d. Jointly develop the Incident Evacuation Plan; ensure that the planning process is conducted under the Unified Command process with input from lead and support agencies as required. Keep in mind that many local jurisdictions have developed emergency evacuation plans for high hazard areas which should be incorporated in evacuation planning. e. Clearly identify on a map the area(s) that are under an imminent threat and/or a potential threat. Maps should utilize a grid system for easy identification of the impacted area. f. Identify evacuation routes to nearest safe location. This information will be critical for determining shelter locations and should be shared with the local emergency services agency, Red Cross, and other NGOs responsible for shelter identification and management. g. For planning purposes, approximately 2,500 autos per lane, per hour can be accommodated on most roads with an average occupancy of four persons per vehicle. h. Planning evacuations for special facilities and populations will require additional time and attention to detail. These may include hospitals, elder care facilities, etc. 2017 ICS 420-1 PROTECTIVE GUIDELINES 21-7

## Page 346

i. Evacuation planning should also consider time lines, transportation needs, and contacts required for large animal evacuations. j. Identify on an incident map locations where people are sheltered-in-place. These areas may require verification by the Operations Section Chief and concurrence from the Incident Commander(s). k. Determine traffic control points. Control points should be located on all sides of the incident and outside the threat area. The perimeter established for traffic control will depend on both the affected population and traffic density. l. Traffic closure levels – Display on incident and public information maps: ● Level 4 or color code Red – closed to all traffic, potential life hazard ● Level 3 or color code Orange – closed to all traffic except emergency responders ● Level 2 or color code Yellow – closed to all traffic except emergency responders and critical resources (e.g., public works, electrical service, animal rescue). ● Level 1 or color code Green – open to above resources and residents only NOTE: Level 1 or color code Green is often referred to as a “soft closure” while Levels 2 through 4 are referred to as “hard closures.” m. The Incident Evacuation Plan should be distributed to all command and general staff members and their subordinates. Additionally, copies should be distributed to all lead and support agencies, local elected officials, and the respective county or city emergency operations centers. 2017 ICS 420-1 PROTECTIVE GUIDELINES 21-8

## Page 347

RE-ENTRY PLANNING CHECKLIST a. Identify re-entry date and time b. Identify area(s) to be re-entered c. Type of re-entry: homeowner/landowner only with identification or general public d. Considerations: ● Is the threat mitigated? ● Are power lines secured? ● Are transportation systems hazards mitigated (e.g., roads cleared, bridges inspected, hazard trees removed)? ● Is Incident Commander’s approval granted? ● Is local law enforcement agency’s approval granted? ● Have other local emergency service agencies approved re-entry (911 service)? ● Are utility agencies informed and support the re-entry decision? ● Have local EOCs been notified and approvals received? 2017 ICS 420-1 PROTECTIVE GUIDELINES 21-9

INTRODUCTION One of the most important issues facing the Incident Commander (IC) is accountability at the scene of emergencies. These Incident Safety and Accountability Guidelines incorporate additional safety measures and accountability that are best practices in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations and pertinent to the Incident Command System (ICS). An accountability system shall be adopted and routinely used to track, collect, and maintain the status and location of the resources at the incident. All members operating at an incident are responsible for understanding and participating in this system. The IC shall be responsible for the overall accountability for the incident. The IC may delegate other command members to facilitate the accountability for those resources to meet those goals, objectives, and tasks as needed. The NFPA 1500 and 1561 Standards contain specific requirements regarding accountability of members, including but not limited to the following: ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS The accountability levels are to provide a clear idea of what each term means and how they are to be used while at an event or incident. These are: ● Personal Accountability ● Single Resource Accountability ● Supervisor Accountability ● Scene Accountability ● Functional Accountability 2017 ICS 420-1 FIREFIGHTER GUIDELINES 22-2

## Page 351

Specific Accountability Definitions and Recommendations These specific accountability definitions and recommendations are to assist a responder with how to maintain accountability while at an event or incident. PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY a. It is the duty of every individual to understand one's role, limitations, and responsibility in accountability. b. Every individual is to remain under supervision at all times and is to refrain from “freelancing.” c. Be constantly aware of the status and location of fellow crew members and other workers near their area of responsibility. SINGLE RESOURCE ACCOUNTABILITY a. During an incident all single resource(s) personnel will check in with the supervisor to whom they are assigned. b. Any department member responding directly to the scene in his/her own vehicle must first check in as required. c. All resources shall provide constant awareness of their status, location, and function throughout the duration of the incident. d. It is the duty of all resources to understand their role, limitations, and responsibility in accountability. e. All resources are to remain under supervision at all times and are to refrain from “freelancing.” f. Be constantly aware of the status of surrounding resources. g. Shall be in constant communication and maintain status of adjoining forces. SUPERVISOR ACCOUNTABILITY a. During an incident, all supervisory personnel will check in with the manager to whom they are assigned. 2017 ICS 420-1 FIREFIGHTER GUIDELINES 22-3

## Page 352

b. The supervisor shall maintain constant awareness of the status, location, and functions of his/her crew throughout the duration of the incident. c. The supervisor shall include a proactive reporting of accountability through the chain of command. d. The supervisor shall ensure crew cohesion, continuity, and communication. e. Supervisors shall conduct, on a regular and routine basis, an accountability check of their assigned personnel. This should include a PAR when specific tasks are completed or, at a minimum, at the end of an operational period. The accountability check(s) and the results of those checks shall be documented on a Unit/Activity Log (ICS Form 214) or similar tool. ”Freelancing” is defined as any responder operating independently, or in a group, at the incident scene without notifying the Incident Commander and/or without being assigned or delegated a task or function. It must be recognized that there are times when independent action may be appropriate, such as when encountering an immediate threat prior to checking in at an incident. An example of this would be encountering a structure imminently threatened by fire, prior to checking in at an incident facility or having radio contact with the incident. This action is without orders but reasonably can be assumed to be in alignment with the commander’s intent. The obligation is to limit the duration of engagement and to attempt to contact the Incident Commander to relay conditions and actions taken, and seek follow-up orders. SCENE ACCOUNTABILITY a. The IC is responsible to ensure the status, location, and functions of each resource are constantly tracked throughout the incident. b. Upon arrival on scene, each resource shall check in for assignment. 2017 ICS 420-1 FIREFIGHTER GUIDELINES 22-4

## Page 353

c. All personnel on the scene will be tracked through the Command Post with the ICS position, assignment, and resource identifier. Each resource shall have a list of assigned personnel available. d. As the incident increases in complexity, the accountability system shall increase accordingly. FUNCTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY a. Functional accountability shall be used for complex incidents. This requires enhanced scene accountability whereby an IC and/or a designee formally tracks the status, locations, and assignments of all resources/ personnel. Functional accountability shall be documented using an appropriate tracking system such as recording assignments on an Incident Briefing (ICS Form 201). b. Accountability process shall be scalable so it may expand or contract with the complexity of the incident. c. As complexity increases, improved communications should also be attempted (i.e., face-to-face communication, visual contact of crews if possible). ACCOUNTABILITY CHECKLIST Who – Who is the resource? This could be a responder or equipment. Identifies the responder or resource by name(s), assignment, and agency (if assisting agency). Identifies equipment by type and kind. What – What is the resource doing? Identifies the tasks and assignments of the resource. When – When did the person or unit arrive on scene, last check-in (i.e., PAR), become reassigned or demobilized? Where – Where is the resource located/assigned (Division, Group, Staging, ICP)? 2017 ICS 420-1 FIREFIGHTER GUIDELINES 22-5

## Page 354

Why – Why was the resource requested? Identifies the need for the resource. How – How is the accountability process documented/ reported/recorded? ACCOUNTABILITY CONSIDERATIONS Pre-Incident Considerations a. Training on the policies, procedures, and tactics of the accountability system should be a priority to a successful system. b. Pre-written agency policies and standard operation guidelines related to responder emergencies are an integral part of the accountability system. These policies and guidelines, when properly applied at an incident or event, result in solid rescue and recovery plans that are specific to emergency environment and the specific risks faced by responders. c. The organization’s culture must encompass the understanding that a firefighter’s failure to adhere to standard accountability practices places him/her, and all on-scene personnel, in increased danger. Incident Considerations a. There must be an Incident Management Accountability System in place. The task can be accomplished by the Incident Commander or delegated. Accountability procedures must be followed and must track individuals regardless of their location or assignment on the incident (e.g., hazard zone, Camp, Incident Base). b. The Supervisor must continually maintain crew integrity at all times to avoid “freelancing” by individual crew members. 2017 ICS 420-1 FIREFIGHTER GUIDELINES 22-6

## Page 355

c. By maintaining company supervision and crew integrity, initiative and resourcefulness can be closely monitored. d. All personnel must have the ability to communicate with assigned supervisors. e. It is essential that the supervisor or manager be able to account for different crews by means of an “identifier.” f. Access to event/incident shall be maintained and monitored. Resources engaged, staged, or released from functional assignments must do so through the chain of command. g. An accounting of all personnel must be conducted at certain points during the incident/event, when conditions change, or assignments are complete. Post-Incident Considerations a. Provide post-incident summary of the event for review. b. Discuss and review relevant situations where accountability was a factor during the incident/event. c. Provide actions taken and lessons learned that would encourage or possibly prevent the same issue(s) from occurring again. d. Upon release from an incident, assigned resource will contact the home unit or base to inform of release status and travel time, then again upon arrival. 2017 ICS 420-1 FIREFIGHTER GUIDELINES 22-7

FIREFIGHTER EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS TERMS & PROCEDURES The fire department standard operating procedures shall provide direction in the use of clear-text radio messages for emergency incidents. Emergency Traffic “Emergency traffic” shall be used as a designator to clear the radio traffic for an emergency affecting the incident and can be declared by any member who becomes aware of an emergency affecting the incident. When a member declares “emergency traffic”, that person shall use clear-text to identify the type of emergency, change in conditions, or tactical operations. Examples of “emergency traffic” could be “evacuate the building”, “wind shift from North to South”, “change from offensive to defensive operations”, “electrical wires down”, or “shots fired.” Mayday “Mayday” shall be used as the designator to identify when a member is in a life-threatening situation and in need of immediate assistance. "Mayday" can be declared by any member who becomes aware of a member who is in a life- threatening situation and in need of immediate assistance. “Mayday, mayday, mayday” shall be broadcast followed by clear-text to identify the type of emergency (“RESPONDER DOWN”, “RESPONDER MISSING”, or “RESPONDER TRAPPED”) to all incident personnel. Once a “mayday” has been declared and broadcast on the radio using the distinctive emergency traffic alert tones, the IC must take action to determine the members’ location, situation, and the resources needed to facilitate assistance (NFPA 1561 6.3.2.2, 2014 Edition). 2017 ICS 420-1 FIREFIGHTER GUIDELINES 22-8

## Page 357

Dispatch Communications Other guidelines for “Emergency Traffic” or “Mayday” include the Dispatch Center or Incident Commander transmitting a distinctive emergency traffic alert tone on a designated channel(s) followed by a clear-text verbal message that identifies the type of emergency. Conclusion of Emergency Situation At the conclusion of the “mayday” or the “emergency traffic” situation, the IC should transmit an “All clear, resume radio traffic.” on all assigned radio channels. Incident Clock The fire department communications center shall start an incident clock when the first arriving unit is on-scene of a working structure fire or hazardous materials incident, or when other conditions appear to be time sensitive or dangerous (NFPA 1500 8.2.4, 2013 Edition). The dispatch center shall notify the Incident Commander at every 10-minute increment with the time that resources have been on the incident until the fire is knocked down or the incident becomes static (NFPA 1500 8.2.4.1, 2013 Edition). The Incident Commander shall be permitted to cancel the incident clock notification through the fire department communications center based on the incident conditions. 2017 ICS 420-1 FIREFIGHTER GUIDELINES 22-9

## Page 358

RAPID INTERVENTION CREW/COMPANY MEMBERS Rapid Intervention personnel have two very important duties. These are: ● Monitor designated radio channel(s) while standing by and during rescue operations. ● Be fully prepared to participate in the rescue of a downed firefighter as assigned by the Incident Commander or Operations Section Chief. In the initial stages of an incident where only one team is operating in the hazardous area at a working structural fire, a minimum of four individuals is required, consisting of two individuals working as a team in the hazard area and two individuals present outside this hazard area for assistance or rescue at emergency operations where entry into the danger area is required. The standby members shall be responsible for maintaining a constant awareness of the number and identity of members operating in the hazardous area, their location and function, and time of entry. The standby members shall remain in radio, visual, voice or signal-line communications with the team (NFPA 1500 8.8.2 – 8.8.2.3. 2013 Edition). Members that arrive on the scene of a working structural fire prior to the assembling of four persons can initiate exterior actions in preparation for an interior attack. Initial attack operations shall be organized to ensure that, if upon arrival at the emergency scene, initial attack personnel find an imminent life-threatening situation which immediate action could prevent the loss of life or serious injury, such action shall be permitted with less than four personnel. No exception shall be permitted when there is no possibility to save lives. Any such actions taken in accordance with this section shall be thoroughly investigated by the fire department 2017 ICS 420-1 FIREFIGHTER GUIDELINES 22-10

## Page 359

with a written report submitted to the Fire Chief (NFPA 1500 8.8.2.10 – 8.8.2.10.2, 2013 Edition) In the initial stages of an incident, the IC supervises the RIC. As the incident grows in complexity, this supervision can be assigned to the Operations Section Chief or even to individual Divisions to ensure the most rapid and effective deployment on a rescue. When sufficient personnel are on scene, the rapid intervention capability for the incident should be raised from the two-in, two- out minimum to include an entire crew or company dedicated as the RIC. In some instances, such as multiple and/or remote entrance points, multiple RIC elements should be assigned and a Rapid Intervention Group Supervisor activated to supervise positioning and deployment of these Crews/Companies. In High Rise fire incidents, the RIC should typically be located at Staging. This will allow for RICs to be deployed in a timely manner. Consider multiple RICs if multiple floors are involved with positioning based on the assigned floor. The assignment of resources to the rescue effort should continue as requested by the officer in charge of the rescue effort. Once the rescue is properly staffed, the IC shall reestablish the rapid intervention capability by identifying an additional resource(s) as the RIC. The IC must ensure that crews in the immediate vicinity of the downed firefighter are properly reassigned to assist in the rescue effort as appropriate. This may include continuing to control the spread of fire or mitigating other situations that jeopardize the firefighter or rescue effort. 2017 ICS 420-1 FIREFIGHTER GUIDELINES 22-11

## Page 360

ADDITIONAL RAPID INTERVENTION CONSIDERATIONS When preparing for a firefighter rescue, consider the worst- case scenario. Rapid Intervention Crew/Company (RIC) standard operating guidelines are incident-driven. Officers or members assigned the task of RIC shall not get involved in routine firefighting activities but remain in a state of readiness, keeping company members together and ready for deployment. OPERATIONAL RETREAT GUIDELINES In addition to radio traffic requiring evacuation, the following standardized audible signal can be used to indicate evacuation. The EVACUATION SIGNAL will consist of repeated short blasts of the air horn for approximately 10 seconds, followed by 10 seconds of silence. This sequence of air horn blasts will be done three times; total air horn evacuation signal including periods of silence will last 50 seconds. This should be done in conjunction with the radio announcement of “EMERGENCY TRAFFIC,” with direction for emergency scene personnel to evacuate the hazard area. The Dispatch Center should continue to advise the Incident Commander of the elapsed time at each additional 10-minute interval, or until canceled by the Incident Commander, or until the incident is declared under control (i.e., knockdown). 2017 ICS 420-1 FIREFIGHTER GUIDELINES 22-12

IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF LIFE HAZARD ZONES INTRODUCTION Incident Commanders are responsible for the safety of all incident personnel and may have to take actions to protect personnel from life-threatening conditions that on-scene fire personnel and other responders do not have the capabilities, tools, or training to immediately mitigate. These actions may include: ● Immediate notification of personnel ● Notification for ongoing or long-term life hazards ● Methods to isolate and clearly identify the life hazard with three strands of barrier tape ● Assignment of Lookouts or Assistant Safety Officers when needed ● Identification methods for remote or large area life hazards The clearly identifiable method to assure that fire personnel and other responders do not enter Life Hazard Zones includes the use of a minimum of three (3) horizontal strands of barrier tape that states “Do Not Enter” or “Do Not Cross”, securely fixed to stationary supports and in sufficient locations, will meet the requirement of identifying a Life Hazard Zone and prevent entry into the hazardous area. DEFINITIONS Life Hazard : The existence of a process or condition that would likely cause serious injury or death to exposed persons. Life Hazard Zones : A system of barriers surrounding designated areas at the incident scene that is intended to STOP fire personnel and other responders from entering a potentially Life-Threatening, Hazardous Area. 2017 ICS 420-1 FIREFIGHTER GUIDELINES 22-13

## Page 362

Life Hazard Lookout : A qualified person in a location where he/she can safely observe a Life Hazard, monitor resources and personnel in the area, and communicate with resources keeping them a safe distance away. The Lookout will also isolate and deny entry to any responders or resources until the Life Hazard is mitigated and the Incident Commander approves the release of the Life Hazard Zone. INFORMATION AND GUIDELINES Whenever a Life Hazard or an immediate threat to the health and safety of incident personnel is present at an incident, any person who recognizes the potential Life Hazard shall immediately contact the Incident Commander using “ EMERGENCY TRAFFIC ” and advise them of the situation. Included in the Emergency Traffic notification: ● Type/Nature of the hazardous condition (e.g., downed electrical wires, imminent building collapse) ● Specific location ● Resource needs ● Any immediate exposure needs or issues The Incident Commander shall request the appropriate resource or agency (e.g., Utility Company, Structural Engineer) to respond to the incident to evaluate and mitigate the Life Hazard and assign a Lookout or Assistant Safety Officer until the establishment of Life Hazard Zone(s). The Incident Commander shall assign a Life Hazard Lookout to prevent any incident personnel from entering the area until such time as the procedures below have been completed. 2017 ICS 420-1 FIREFIGHTER GUIDELINES 22-14

## Page 363

IDENTIFICATION OF LIFE HAZARD ZONES a. The standard for identification of a LIFE HAZARD ZONE: 1. Deploy barrier tape in the following manner to prevent entry and identify the hazard zone. The optimal tape would be red-and-white striped or chevron barrier tape that states “ Life Hazard – Do Not Enter ”; however, existing fireline or police perimeter tape that includes the words “Do Not Enter” or “Do Not Cross” will meet this standard. 2. The tape shall be configured in three horizontal strands approximately 18 to 24 inches apart and securely fixed to stationary supports to establish the LIFE HAZARD ZONE. The LIFE HAZARD ZONE barrier shall be of sufficient size to provide complete isolation, distance, and protection from the hazard, and supports shall be capable of supporting the barrier tape throughout the incident. 3. The use of illumination is recommended to enhance nighttime visibility to further identify the LIFE HAZARD ZONE. Examples include orange cones with a flashing strobe light on the ground or glow sticks securely attached to the barrier tape. b. The Established Life Hazard Zone: 1. THE THREE HORIZONTAL STRAND CONFIGURATION OF RED-AND-WHITE STRIPED OR CHEVRON BARRIER TAPE SHALL ONLY BE USED FOR LIFE HAZARD IDENTIFICATION. WHEN INCIDENT PERSONNEL SEE THE THREE- STRAND CONFIGURATION OR BARRIER TAPE, IT SHALL BE RECOGNIZED AS THE STANDARD FOR ISOLATING A LIFE HAZARD, AND INCIDENT PERSONNEL SHALL NOT ENTER THE LIFE HAZARD ZONE. 2017 ICS 420-1 FIREFIGHTER GUIDELINES 22-15

## Page 364

2. Ensure the LIFE HAZARD ZONE measures provide visibility to approaching personnel to prevent entry into the area throughout the duration of the incident. 3. Maintain the LIFE HAZARD ZONE for the duration of the incident or hazard. Approval from the IC is required prior to the removal of the Life Hazard Zone barriers. 4. The LIFE HAZARD ZONE identification measures are intended to provide a visual cue to all incident personnel. Life Hazard Lookout(s) or Assistant Safety Officers shall be considered to ensure a physical barrier between personnel and the LIFE HAZARD ZONE through effective communications and notifications. 5. The Incident Commander shall be responsible for ensuring that all incident personnel are notified of the Life Hazard Zone. This may be accomplished through any approved method such as face-to-face, emergency traffic radio messages, or the Incident Action Plan. c. Remote Locations: In cases where the extent of the hazard zone is so large that is not practical to completely isolate the area, such as on large incidents in remote locations, the following will be the minimum standard for these situations: 1. The Incident Commander must approve the use of these minimum standards for each Life Hazard: ● The Incident Commander shall assign a Life Hazard Lookout at appropriate access points to prevent any incident personnel from entering the area until such time as the procedures below have been completed. ● Three horizontal strands of red-and-white Life Hazard tape or barrier tape (as described above) will be affixed to two vertical uprights at appropriate locations along the access route to the Life Hazard area. A description of the hazard, location of the hazard, and distance from the 2017 ICS 420-1 FIREFIGHTER GUIDELINES 22-16

## Page 365

Life Hazard indicator tape to the hazard shall be attached at each location. 2. All personnel working in the area or Division shall be notified of the Life Hazard immediately. Incident personnel may be notified through routine briefings, emergency traffic radio messages, the Incident Action Plan, and/or the Incident Map. 3. The location(s) of the Life Hazard(s) and Placard(s) shall be marked on the Incident Map using standardized symbols. The symbol to mark the Life Hazard Zone on the Incident Map is a red octagon (Stop Sign) with three white horizontal lines with a description of the hazard noted underneath. ● Personnel shall not breach, alter, or remove any LIFE HAZARD ZONE identification measures until the hazard has been abated and approval granted by the Incident Commander. ● All personnel have a personal responsibility to be aware of LIFE HAZARDS and make proper notifications when they are encountered at an incident. ● Remember the slogan: THREE STRIPES, YOU’RE OUT!

APPENDIX A COMMUNICATIONS GUIDELINES FIRESCOPE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS GUIDELINES FIRESCOPE Radio Communications Guidelines are derived from the Cooperative Agreements for Use of Radio Frequencies between fire service agencies of California allowing for mutual use of radio channels during mutual aid efforts. VHF Highband is the default radio frequency band utilized by the California fire service. There are one hundred (100) VHF channels that should be pre-programmed into all VHF radios utilized by fire service agencies providing mutual aid in California (see FIRESCOPE Statewide Channel Plan ). Fire service agencies whose normal dispatch system is on a band other than VHF Highband should ensure that their mobile and portable radios and dispatch centers are properly programmed to operate on the UHF , 700 and 800 MHz interoperability channels contained within the FIRESCOPE Statewide Channel Plan. IMPORTANT COMMUNICATIONS ISSUES Travel Channel The California Emergency Services Radio System ( CESRS ) is the only VHF statewide channel authorized for use as a Travel Channel within the State of California. As a Travel Channel, CESRS must be used in the Direct Mode for line-of-sight travel communications. Agencies with a need to contact a State ECC or OES resource during an emergency are authorized to use Repeat Mode. 2017 ICS 420-1 COMMUNICATIONS GUIDELINES A-1

## Page 394

Narrow-banding ALL VHF and UHF radios MUST be Narrowband compliant. Any non-compliant radio equipment used on Narrowband channels may present a life-safety hazard. All radios that are not capable of Narrowband technology shall be taken out of service and not placed into service by another fire service agency (e.g., donations, personal, or volunteer use). Any radios returned to the vendor or disposed of as surplus should have all programming deleted or crystals removed. GUIDELINES 1. While numerous radio channels/talk-groups can be pre- programmed into radios, it is important to note that in order to transmit on those channels/talk-groups, (including channels listed in the FIRESCOPE Statewide Channel Plan) the user: ● Must be authorized by the FCC or NTIA to transmit on those frequencies. ● Must have a radio use agreement or Memorandum of Understanding with the agency which is licensed for the channels, or Must be assigned to an incident with that channel/talk-group listed on the Incident Radio Communications Plan ( ICS Form 205). 2. Any agency requesting mutual aid will advise responding agencies of an initial contact channel for the incident. Generally, the initial contact channel will be VFIRE21. Incident Communications Centers (ICCs) and Staging Area Managers should monitor VFIRE21 or another specified initial contact channel to assist resources arriving at the incident. 3. Local policy will dictate radio channel/talk-group assignments for an incident until a Communications 2017 ICS 420-1 COMMUNICATIONS GUIDELINES A-2

## Page 395

Unit Leader ( COML ) establishes the Incident Radio Communications Plan ( ICS Form 205). 4. The Incident Commander or, if assigned, the Communications Unit Leader is responsible for managing assigned radio channels/talk-groups and must clear the use of local, state and federal frequencies with the controlling agencies prior to inclusion in an Incident Radio Communications Plan ( ICS Form 205). 5. Clear text (plain English) should be used for all communications. CODES SHALL NOT BE USED! Standardized channel/talk-group names should be stated (e.g., “ VFIRE22 ”,or “ NIFC Tac 2”). Channel/talk- group numbers corresponding to how a specific radio is programmed should not be used except if published in an IAP (e.g., “Channel 1”, or “Channel A14”). 6. When calling another unit/ ICS position, the standard is to identify who you are calling first, followed by your call sign (e.g., “Engine 2111, Battalion 2104” or “Division B, Strike Team 6412C”). Recognize that on large mutual aid incidents, there may be several units with the same radio ID . In those cases, the agency name should also be used (e.g., "Oceanside Engine 2111, Oceanside Battalion 2104”). 7. Data communications (i.e., automated or push button status keeping for “computer aided dispatch” ( CAD ) systems) SHALL NOT be used outside the local agency’s normal area of operation. 8. Radio programming that enables data signaling (e.g., MDC1200 push-to-talk identification) is prohibited on interoperability channels (e.g., VFIRE22 , VFIRE23 ). 9. Vehicular repeater systems (mobile extenders) SHALL NOT be used outside the local agency’s normal area of operation. 2017 ICS 420-1 COMMUNICATIONS GUIDELINES A-3

## Page 396

10. The use of gateways (including portable, mobile or fixed) shall be limited to the smallest geographical area of coverage to meet the temporary needs of the incident. Gateways shall only be used on channels/talk-groups that are specifically licensed for that type of operation (i.e., temporary mobile relay) and must be specifically authorized based upon an approved Incident Radio Communications Plan ( ICS Form 205) or be recognized as a fixed gateway, included in the California Statewide Communications Interoperability Plan (Cal- SCIP ). 11. Family Radio Service ( FRS ) and Relm/BendixKing( BK ) EPH radios are prohibited from use on Federal and State of California incidents. Use of any non-public safety radio (e.g., FRS, GMRS ), or use of a frequency/talk-group not identified on the Incident Radio Communications Plan ( ICS Form 205) is prohibited. 12. The use of any frequency outside the agency’s normal, licensed area of operation is prohibited by FCC and NTIA rules and will likely cause harmful interference to other users (i.e., Strike Teams using a local channel in a distant part of the state).The FCC will enforce this rule beginning 2015. FIRESCOPE STATEWIDE CHANNEL PLAN The FIRESCOPE Statewide Channel Plan was developed to assist California Fire Service agencies in buying and programming synthesized radios so as to maximize their effectiveness for mutual aid responses. Regardless of the radio system used on a daily basis, all California Fire Service agencies should maintain an adequate number of VHF mobile and portable radios to support mutual aid operations. In addition to the VHF interoperability channels, UHF , 700 and 800 MHz interoperability channels are also available to support mutual aid and all-risk incidents. 2017 ICS 420-1 COMMUNICATIONS GUIDELINES A-4
