# After Action Review (AAR) – Part 1

![6MFS decorative banner. Logo on left, image of wildland firefighters walking into woods with a female firefighter in foreground talking on a radio.](https://fs-prod-nwcg.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2024-12/6mfs-comms-hdr.jpg?VersionId=.C1KyTEBE2hgozwHjW7Vi6dKk_HGiRkv)

## How to Conduct an Effective After Action Review (AAR)

An AAR is a professional discussion of an event. The objective is to identify successes and failures. It is a tool that leaders, teams, crews, and units can use to get maximum learning benefit from every incident or project. It is essential for wildland firefighters to learn from mistakes and to capitalize on successes. It is considered a valuable tool in high-risk professions, where the smallest mistakes can lead to disastrous results. **An AAR is not a critique and not a forum to assign blame. It is an open, honest, and professional discussion for purposes of improvement.**

Once you (the leader/facilitator) have demonstrated that the AAR works and that it will be part of your team's standard operating procedures, the discussion will become more open. Finding out **what** they did is not nearly as important as **why** they did it. Good active listening skills are essential. Do not immediately try to solve or correct the issue, but let it play out. Try to get to the root of the issue. The leader must be a part of the AAR and will have to accept criticism. This is important because the team will be looking for affirmation of the AAR process.

* An AAR is performed as immediately after the event as possible by the personnel involved.
* The leader’s role is to ensure skilled facilitation of the AAR.
* Reinforce that respectful disagreement is okay. Keep focused on the what, not the who.
* Make sure everyone participates.
* Pay attention to time.
* Establish clear ground rules: encourage candor and openness, all participants have equal ownership, focus on improving performance, and keep all discussions confidential.
* End the AAR on a positive note.

***1\. What was planned?***

Review the intent of the mission 
Desired end state (what does right look like).

***2\. What actually happened?***

Establish the facts 
Pool multiple perspectives to build a shared picture of what happened.

***3\. Why did it happen?***

Analysis of cause and effect 
Provide progressive refinement for drawing out explanations of what occurred.

***4\. What are we going to do next time?***

Correct weaknesses and sustain strengths 
Focus on items you can fix, rather than external forces outside of your control.

NWCG is excited to announce that the Quarter Two materials for the 2025/2026 Wildland Fire Leadership Campaign are now available! This annual initiative invites all leadership and wildland fire management students to engage with essential skills and knowledge needed to lead effectively in dynamic environments.

This quarter focuses on Leadership Level 2: New Leader (Conveying Intent). Conveying intent is a crucial leadership competency in the high-risk, dynamic environment of wildland firefighting. Months 4 - 6 will concentrate on how successfully conveying intent enhances situational awareness, promotes shared understanding, and empowers firefighters to exercise initiative and adapt to changing conditions.
