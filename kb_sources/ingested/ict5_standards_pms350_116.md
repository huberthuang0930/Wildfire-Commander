The National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) provides national leadership to enable interoperable wildland fire operations among federal, state, T ribal, territorial, and local partners. NWCG operations standards are interagency by design; they are developed with the intent of universal adoption by the member agencies . However, the decision to adopt and utilize them is made independently by the individual member agencies and communicated through their respective directives systems. NWCG Incident Position Standards f or Incident Commander Type 5 June 2025 PMS 350 - 1 16 The NWCG Incident Position Standards for Incident Commander Type 5 establish es national interagency standards for operating as a n Incident Commander Type 5 (ICT5) on wildland fires. The se standards are meant to ensure safe, efficient, and effective operations in support of inter agency goals and objectives and should serve as a guide to promote effective and consistent on - incident training. By definition, NWCG standards encompass guidelines, procedures, processes, best practices, specifications, techniques, and methods. The Incident Commander Type 5 Posit ion Page, https://www.nwcg.gov/positions/incident - commander - type - 5 , in the NWCG p osition c atalog , includes the Incident Position Description (IPD) and Position Qualification Requirements , as well as links to standards and references needed to perform the duties of a n Incident Commander Type 5 . T asks that are identified by a ( * ) are those tasks included for evaluation in the Position Task Book (PTB). Tasks not identified for evaluation in the PTB still represent standards for successful performance in the position and should be included in a comprehensive training assignment. Where references are identified by a (**), r efer to your home unit, agency, or organization for specific guidance and policy documentation. For example: **Interagency Standards for Fire and Fire Aviation Operations (Red Book)
