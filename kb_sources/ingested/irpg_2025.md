The National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) provides national leadership to enable interoperable wildland fire operations among federal, state, Tribal, territorial, and local partners. NWCG operations standards are interagency by design; they are developed with the intent of universal adoption by the member agencies. However, the decision to adopt and utilize them is made independently by the individual member agencies and communicated through their respective directives systems. NWCG Incident Response Pocket Guide (IRPG) January 2025 PMS 461 NFES 001077 The NWCG Incident Response Pocket Guide ( IRPG ) establishes standards for wildland fire incident response. The guide provides critical information on operational engagement, risk management, fire environment, all hazard response, and aviation management. It is a collection of guidelines, checklists, and best practices that have evolved over time within wildland fire operations. The intended target audience of the IRPG is field-going wildland fire and aviation personnel from the Incident Commander Type 3 (ICT3) and Division/Group Supervisor (DIVS) level and down. The size makes it easy to fit in a firefighter’s pocket, staying true to the purpose and intent. The IRPG does not provide absolute solutions to the unlimited number of situations that will occur. Some fireline decisions may be relatively simple; many are not. These decisions often require individual judgment, creativity, and collaboration — skills developed through extensive training, dedicated practice, and experience, which the guide facilitates.

IRPG v Operational Leadership The most essential element of successful wildland firefighting is competent and confident leadership. Leadership means providing purpose, direction, and motivation for wildland firefighters working to accomplish difficult tasks under dangerous, stressful circumstances. In confusing and uncertain situations, a good operational leader will: • TAKE CHARGE of assigned resources. • ASSESS SITUATION by gaining intel. • MOTIVATE firefighters with a “can do safely” attitude. • DEMONSTRATE INITIATIVE by taking action in the absence of orders. • COMMUNICATE by giving specific instructions and asking for feedback. • SUPERVISE at the scene of action.

## Page 9

IRPG vi DUTY Be proficient in your job, both technically and as a leader. • Take charge when in charge. • Adhere to professional standard operating procedures. • Develop a plan to accomplish given objectives. Make sound and timely decisions. • Maintain situation awareness in order to anticipate needed actions. • Develop contingencies and consider consequences. • Improvise within the leader’s intent to handle a rapidly changing environment. Ensure tasks are understood, supervised, and accomplished. • Issue clear instructions. • Observe and assess actions in progress without micro- managing. • Use positive feedback to modify duties, tasks, and assignments when appropriate. Develop your subordinates for the future. • Clearly state expectations. • Delegate tasks that you are not required to do personally. • Consider individual skill levels and developmental needs when assigning tasks.

## Page 10

IRPG vii RESPECT Know your subordinates and look out for their well- being. • Put the safety of your subordinates above all other objectives. • Take care of your subordinates’ needs. • Resolve conflicts between individuals on the team. Keep your subordinates informed. • Provide accurate and timely briefings. • Give the reason (intent) for assignments and tasks. • Make yourself available to answer questions at appropriate times. Build the team. • Conduct frequent debriefings with the team to identify lessons learned. • Recognize individual and team accomplishments and reward them appropriately. • Apply disciplinary measures equally. Employ your subordinates in accordance with their capabilities. • Observe human behavior as well as fire behavior. • Provide early warning to subordinates of tasks they will be responsible for. • Consider team experience, fatigue, and physical limitations when accepting assignments.

## Page 11

IRPG viii INTEGRITY Know yourself and seek improvement. • Know the strengths and weaknesses in your character and skill level. • Ask questions of peers and superiors. • Actively listen to feedback from subordinates. Seek responsibility and accept responsibility for your actions. • Accept full responsibility for poor team performance. • Credit subordinates for good performance. • Keep your superiors informed of your actions. Set the example. • Share the hazards and hardships with your subordinates. • Don’t show discouragement when facing setbacks. • Choose the difficult right over the easy wrong.

## Page 12

IRPG ix Communication Responsibilities All firefighters have five communication responsibilities: • Brief others as needed. • Debrief your actions. • Communicate hazards to others. • Acknowledge messages. • Ask if you don’t know. Leader’s Intent Additionally, all leaders of firefighters have the responsibility to provide complete briefings and ensure that their subordinates have a clear understanding of their intent for the assignment: • Task = What is to be done? • Purpose = Why it is to be done? • End State = How should it look when done?

## Page 13

IRPG x Human Factor Barriers to Situation Awareness Low Experience Level with Local Factors • Unfamiliar with the area or the organizational structure. Distraction from Primary Task • Radio traffic. • Conflict. • Previous errors. • Collateral duties. • Incident Within an Incident (IWI). Fatigue • Carbon monoxide. • Dehydration. • Heat stress. • Poor fitness level can reduce resistance to fatigue. • 24 hours awake affects your decision-making capability like .10 blood alcohol content.

## Page 14

IRPG xi Stress Reactions • Communication deteriorates or grows tense. • Habitual or repetitive behavior. • Target fixation – Locking into a course of action; whether it makes sense or not, just try harder. • Action tunneling – Focusing on small tasks, but ignoring the big picture. • Escalation of commitment – Accepting increased risk as completion of task gets near. Hazardous Attitudes • Invulnerable – That can’t happen to us. • Anti-authority – Disregard of the team effort. • Impulsive – Do something even if it’s wrong. • Macho – Trying to impress or prove something. • Complacent – Just another routine fire. • Resigned – We can’t make a difference. • Group Think – Afraid to speak up or disagree.

## Page 15

IRPG xii Firefighter Stress Management Wildland firefighting is often stressful and sometimes traumatic. It can take a toll on mental health. It is normal to feel overwhelmed sometimes and it is vital to address these thoughts before they become a mental health issue. Mental fitness for duty is just as essential as physical fitness for duty. AWARENESS – Stress Injuries can be caused by: • A Life Threat : Due to an experience of death-provoking terror, horror, or helplessness. • A Loss Injury : A grief injury due to the loss of cherished people, things, or parts of oneself. • A Moral Injury : Due to behaviors or the witnessing of behaviors that violate moral values. • Cumulative Stress : Due to the accumulation of stress from all sources over time without sufficient rest and recovery. RECOGNITION – Stress Sizeup: Monitor yourself and others for: • Hazardous attitudes and stress reactions (see page xi). • Behavior changes (not talking, isolating, outbursts, increased use of substances, making mistakes). • Troubling feelings (fear, anger, anxiety, sadness, guilt, shame). • Thoughts or mention of self-harm or suicide. MITIGATION – Stress First Aid: • Shrink the stigma – talk about it! • Provide opportunities to calm: ○ Take a tactical stress pause. ○ Refocus; identify what really matters. ○ Try tactical breathing or similar techniques. ○ Get additional time off if needed. • Get help: just like in a medical incident, a higher level of care may be necessary. • Reach out to friends, peers, loved ones, etc., for support.

## Page 16

IRPG xiii After Action Review (AAR) The climate surrounding an AAR must be one in which the participants openly and honestly discuss what transpired, in sufficient detail and clarity, so everyone understands what did and did not occur and why. Most importantly, participants should leave with a strong desire to improve their proficiency. • An AAR is performed as immediately after the event as possible by the personnel involved. • The leader’s role is to ensure skilled facilitation of the AAR. • Reinforce that respectful disagreement is okay. Keep focused on the what, not the who. • Make sure everyone participates. • End the AAR on a positive note. What was planned? What actually happened? Why did it happen? What can we do next time? (Correct weaknesses/sustain strengths)

IRPG – Operational Engagement (Green) 2 of 122 Planning for Medical Emergencies Prior to each operational period, Incident Commanders (ICs), supervisors, and all wildland firefighters need to ask and be able to answer the following three questions: 1. What are we going to do if someone gets hurt? • Are there personnel on your crew/division/fire that can provide medical support? • What type of equipment is available to treat and transport injured personnel? 2. How will we get them out of here? • Could you get an injured firefighter to a road or helispot? • How many personnel and what kind of equipment would you need to get an injured firefighter out? 3. How long will it take to get them to a hospital? • Where is the closest hospital? • Will you use air or ground transportation? • Could conditions change and affect the transportation timeline? - Smoke/clouds/nightfall - Fire behavior - Mechanical failures All operational activities should be based on answers to these questions. If the answers are insufficient, stop, reassess, and consider alternate strategies and tactics. Reference Medical Incident Report, ICS 206 WF, on page 120.

IRPG – Operational Engagement (Green) 3 of 122 Common Denominators of Fire Behavior on Tragedy Fires There are five major common denominators of fire behavior on fatal and near-fatal fires. Such fires often occur: 1. On relatively small fires or deceptively quiet areas of large fires. 2. In relatively light fuels, such as grass, herbaceous fuels, and light brush. 3. When there is an unexpected shift in wind direction or in wind speed. 4. When fire responds to topographic conditions and runs uphill. 5. During critical burn period between 1400 and 1700. Alignment of topography and wind during the critical burning period should be considered a trigger point to reevaluate tactics. Blowup to burnover conditions generally occur in less than 60 minutes and can be as little as 5 minutes. A tactical pause may be prudent around 1400 for reevaluating your situation awareness of topography, weather, and fuel.

## Page 20

IRPG – Operational Engagement (Green) 4 of 122 Common Tactical Hazards Position • Building fireline downhill. • Building undercut or mid-slope fireline. • Building indirect fireline or unburned fuel is between you and the fire. • Attempting frontal assault on the fire or you are delivered by aircraft to the top of the fire. • Establishing escape routes that are uphill or difficult to travel. Situation • Poor communication due to a rapidly emerging small fire or an isolated area of a large fire. • Suppression resources are fatigued or inadequate. • Assignment or escape route depends on aircraft support. • Nighttime operations. • Wildland urban interface (WUI) operations. When selected tactics put firefighters in these positions or situations, a higher level of risk is involved. Consider additional hazard controls that may be needed.

## Page 21

IRPG – Operational Engagement (Green) 5 of 122 LCES Lookouts, Communications, Escape Routes, Safety Zones LCES must be established and known to ALL firefighters BEFORE it is needed. Lookout(s) • Experienced, competent, trusted • Enough lookouts at good vantage points • Knowledge of crew locations • Knowledge of escape and safety locations • Knowledge of trigger points • Map, weather kit, watch, Incident Action Plan (IAP) Communication(s) • Radio frequencies confirmed • Backup procedures and check-in times established • Provide updates on any situation change • Sound alarm early, not late Escape Route(s) • More than one escape route • Avoid steep, uphill escape routes • Scouted for loose soils, rocks, vegetation • Timed considering slowest person, fatigue, and temperature factors • Marked for day or night • Evaluate escape time vs. rate of spread • Vehicles parked for escape Safety Zone(s) • Survivable without a fire shelter • Back into clean burn • Natural features (rock areas, water, meadows) • Constructed sites (clear-cuts, roads, helispots) • Scouted for size and hazards • Upslope? Downwind? Heavy fuels? Each means more heat impact meaning larger safety zone. Time available to use escape routes will decrease and safety zone size will increase (possibly by more than double) as wind exceeds 10 mph and/or slope exceeds 20%!

## Page 22

IRPG – Operational Engagement (Green) 6 of 122 Safety Zones A safety zone is an area where a firefighter can survive without a fire shelter. Considerations for effective safety zones: • Take advantage of heat barriers such as lee side of ridges, large rocks, or solid structures. • When possible, burn out safety zones prior to arrival of the fire front. • Avoid locations that are upslope or downwind from the fire, chimneys, saddles, narrow canyons, and steep, uphill escape routes. • Not intended for structure protection. Separation distance between the firefighter and the flames should be at least four times the maximum continuous flame height. Distance separation for flat terrain and no wind is the radius from the center of the safety zone to the nearest fuels. Flame Height 10’ 20’ 50’ 100’ 200’ Separation Distance (firefighters to flames) 40’ 80’ 200’ 400’ 800’ Area in Acres* 1 / 10 acre ½ acre 3 acres 12 acres 46 acres *Area in acres is calculated to allow for distance separation on all sides for a 3-person engine crew (1 acre is approximately the size of a football field, or 208’ by 208’). Calculations are based on radiant heat only and do not account for convective heat from wind and/or terrain influences. Since calculations assume no wind and no slope, safety zones downwind or upslope from the fire will require larger separation distances.

## Page 23

IRPG – Operational Engagement (Green) 7 of 122 Downhill Fireline Construction Checklist Downhill fireline construction is hazardous in steep terrain, fast-burning fuels, or rapidly changing weather. It should not be attempted unless there is no tactical alternative. When building downhill fireline, the following are required: 1. Discuss assignments with crew supervisor(s) and fireline overhead prior to committing crew(s). Responsible overhead individual stays with job until completed (Task Force Leader [TFLD] or Incident Commander Type 4 [ICT4] qualified at minimum). 2. Decision is made after proposed fireline has been scouted by supervisor(s) of involved crew(s). 3. Coordinate LCES for all personnel involved. • Crew supervisor(s) in direct contact with lookout who can see the fire. • Establish communication between all crews. • Rapid access to safety zone(s) in case fire crosses below crew(s). 4. Use direct attack whenever possible. If not possible, the fireline should be completed between anchor points before being fired out. 5. Fireline will not lie in or adjacent to a chute or chimney. 6. Starting point will be anchored for crew(s) building fireline down from the top. 7. Monitor bottom of fire; if potential exists for the fire to spread, take action to secure the fire edge.

IRPG – Operational Engagement (Green) 8 of 122 Indicators of Incident Complexity Common indicators may include the area (location) involved; threat to life, environment and property; political sensitivity, organizational complexity, jurisdictional boundaries, values at risk, and weather. Most indicators are common to all incidents, but some may be unique to a particular type of incident. The following are common contributing indicators of incident complexity. Type 5 Incident Complexity Indicators General Indicators Span of Control Indicators • Incident is typically terminated or concluded (objective met) within a short time once resources arrive on scene. • For incidents managed for resource objectives, minimal staffing/oversight is required. • Resources vary from two to six firefighters. • Formal Incident Planning Process not needed. • Written Incident Action Plan (IAP) not needed. • Minimal effects to population immediately surrounding the incident. • Critical Infrastructure, or Key Resources, not adversely affected. • Incident Commander (IC) position filled. • Single resources are directly supervised by the IC. • Command and General Staff positions not needed to reduce workload or span of control. Type 4 Incident Complexity Indicators General Indicators Span of Control Indicators • Incident objectives are typically met within one operational period once resources arrive on scene, but resources may remain on scene for multiple operational periods. • Multiple resources may be needed. • Resources may require limited logistical support. • Formal Incident Planning Process not needed. • Written Incident Action Plan (IAP) not needed. • Limited effects to population surrounding incident. • Critical Infrastructure or Key Resources may be adversely affected, but mitigation measures are uncomplicated and can be implemented within one Operational Period. • Elected and appointed governing officials, stakeholder groups, and political organizations require little or no interaction. • IC role filled. • Resources either directly supervised by the IC or supervised through an ICS Leader position. • Task Forces or Strike Teams may be used to reduce span of control to an acceptable level. • Command Staff positions normally not filled to reduce workload or span of control. • General Staff position(s) normally not filled to reduce workload or span of control.

## Page 25

IRPG – Operational Engagement (Green) 9 of 122 Type 3 Incident Complexity Indicators* General Indicators Span of Control Indicators • Incident typically extends into multiple operational periods. • Incident objectives usually not met within the first or second operational period. • Resources may need to remain at scene for multiple operational periods, requiring logistical support. • Numerous kinds and types of resources may be required. • Formal Incident Planning Process is initiated and followed. • Written Incident Action Plan (IAP) needed for each Operational Period. • Responders may range up to 200 total personnel. • Incident may require an Incident Base to provide support. • Population surrounding incident affected. • Critical Infrastructure or Key Resources may be adversely affected and actions to mitigate effects may extend into multiple Operational Periods. • Elected and appointed governing officials, stakeholder groups, and political organizations require some level of interaction. • IC role filled. • Numerous resources supervised indirectly through the establishment and expansion of the Operations Section and its subordinate positions. • Division Supervisors, Group Supervisors, Task Forces, and Strike Teams used to reduce span of control to an acceptable level. • Command Staff positions may be filled to reduce workload or span of control. • General Staff position(s) may be filled to reduce workload or span of control. • ICS functional units may need to be filled to reduce workload. *If multiple Type 3 Incident Complexity Indicators are exceeded, consider the next level of incident management support.

IRPG – Operational Engagement (Green) 10 of 122 Firing Operations Successful firing operations must be both well timed and coordinated. Adequate resources must be present for both firing and holding. Always have a contingency plan and ensure the following are met before conducting firing operations: • All personnel briefed • Spot forecast requested • Weather forecast reviewed • Frequency management established • Lookouts posted as needed • Anchor/termination firing points identified • Notifications made: ○ Division resources ○ Adjoining resources ○ Fireline supervisors ○ Aerial supervisors • All resources in place identified Escape routes and safety zones identified and made known to all resources. Night Shift / Day Shift Transitions Effective transitions must occur between night and day shifts. Items to consider when transitioning: • Plan to transition in daylight. • Transitions should occur between operationally knowledgeable individuals from both shifts. • Transition briefings should include: o Weather o Line location o Significant events o Terrain features o Fire behavior o Hazards o Expected concerns

## Page 27

IRPG – Operational Engagement (Green) 11 of 122 Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) Firefighting Structure protection is inherently dangerous because it involves indirect firefighting. Do not commit to stay and protect a structure unless a safety zone for firefighters and equipment has been identified at the structure during sizeup and triage. Move to the nearest safety zone, let the fire front pass, and return as soon as conditions allow. Fire Behavior Prediction • Base all actions on current and expected fire behavior – do this first! • An estimate must be made of the approaching fire intensity in order to determine if there is an adequate safety zone and time available before the fire arrives. • Due to the dynamic nature of fire behavior, intensity estimates are difficult to make with absolute certainty. It is imperative that firefighters consider the worst case and build contingency actions into their plan to compensate for the unexpected.

## Page 28

IRPG – Operational Engagement (Green) 12 of 122 Structure Sizeup Site Considerations • Adequate safety zone based on fire behavior prediction. • Adequate lookout and communication capability. • Adequate defensible space based on surrounding wildland vegetation. • Avoid narrow canyon bottoms, mid-slope with fire below, and narrow ridges near chimneys and saddles. Tactical Challenges and Hazards Firefighters with a safety zone can safely defend structures with some challenges. • Narrow roads, unknown bridge limits, and septic tank locations. • Ornamental plants and combustible debris within 30 feet of structure. • Wooden siding and/or wooden roof materials. • Open vents, eaves, decks, and other ember traps. • Fuel tanks and hazardous materials. • Powerlines or underground utilities. • Limited water sources. • Prevailing sense of urgency. • Property owners remaining on site or evacuations. • Smoke byproducts often laced with chemical compounds not found in wildland fires.

## Page 29

IRPG – Operational Engagement (Green) 13 of 122 Structure Triage Defensible – Prep and Hold Determining Factor: Safety zone present. Sizeup: Structure has some tactical challenges. Tactics: Firefighters needed on site to implement structure protection tactics during fire front contact. Defensible – Standalone Determining Factor: Safety zone present. Sizeup: Structure has very few tactical challenges. Tactics: Firefighters may not need to be directly assigned to protect structure as it is not likely to ignite during initial fire front contact. However, no structure in the path of a wildfire is completely without need of protection. Patrol following the passage of the fire front will be needed to protect the structure.

## Page 30

IRPG – Operational Engagement (Green) 14 of 122 Non-Defensible – Prep and Leave Determining Factor: NO safety zone present. Sizeup: Structure has some tactical challenges. Tactics: Firefighters not able to commit to stay and protect structure. If time allows, rapid mitigation measures may be performed. Set trigger point for safe retreat. Remember, pre-incident preparation is the responsibility of the homeowner . Patrol following the passage of the fire front will be needed to protect the structure. Non-Defensible – Rescue Drive-By Determining Factor: NO safety zone present. Sizeup: Structure has significant tactical challenges. Tactics: Firefighters not able to commit to stay and protect structure. If time allows, check to ensure that people are not present in the threatened structure (especially children, elderly, and those with disabilities). Set trigger point for safe retreat. Patrol following the passage of the fire front will be needed to protect the structure.

## Page 31

IRPG – Operational Engagement (Green) 15 of 122 Structure Protection Tactics Rapid Mitigation Measures • Remove small combustibles immediately next to structure. • Close windows and doors, including garage (leave unlocked). • Clean area around fuel tank and shut off tank. • Charge garden hoses. • Apply Class A foam, or gel retardants if available. Equipment and Water Use • Mark entrance to indicate a staffed location if it is not obvious. • Charge hose lines. • Long hose lays are not recommended. • Keep 100 gallons of water in reserve. • Identify a backup water source. • Identify powerlines for aerial resources. • Never rely on water for firefighter safety. Patrol Following the Fire Front • Many structures do not burn until after the fire front has passed. • Be aware of the structural collapse zone when structures are exposed to fire. • Move to closest safety zone and let fire front go through. • Return as soon as conditions allow safe access to structures. • Secondary ignition is usually due to residual spot fires or creeping ground fire. • Take suppression actions within your capability. • Call for assistance if needed.

IRPG – Specific Hazards (Gray) 17 of 122 SPEC IFIC HA ZARD S (gray pages) Thunderstorm Safety Approaching thunderstorms may be noted by a sudden reverse in wind direction, a noticeable rise in wind speed, and a sharp drop in temperature. Rain, hail, and lightning occur only in the mature stage of a thunderstorm. Situation Awareness: Sound waves move at different rates based on atmospheric conditions. Take the storm precautions below as soon as you hear thunder, not when the storm is upon you. Do not resume work in exposed areas until 30 minutes after storm activity has passed. Hazard Control: • Take shelter in a vehicle or building if possible. • If outdoors, find a low spot away from tall trees, wire fences, utility lines, and other elevated conductive objects. Pick a place that is not subject to flooding. • If in the woods, move to an area with shorter trees. • If only isolated trees are nearby, keep your distance twice the tree height. • If in open country, crouch low with feet together, minimizing contact with the ground. You can use a pack to sit on, but never lie on the ground. • If you feel your skin tingle or your hair stand on end, immediately crouch low to the ground. Make yourself the smallest possible target and minimize your contact with the ground. • Don’t group together. • Don’t stay on ridge tops, in wide open areas, or near ledges or rock outcroppings. • Don’t operate landline telephones, machinery, or electric motors. • Don’t handle metal hand tools or flammable materials in open containers.

IRPG – Specific Hazards (Gray) 18 of 122 How to Properly Refuse Risk Every individual has the right and obligation to report safety problems and contribute ideas regarding their safety. Supervisors are expected to give these concerns and ideas serious consideration. When an individual feels an assignment is unsafe, they also have the obligation to identify, to the degree possible, safe alternatives for completing that assignment. Turning down an assignment is one possible outcome of managing risk. A turn down is a situation where an individual has determined they cannot undertake an assignment as given and they are unable to negotiate an alternative solution. The turn down of an assignment must be based on an assessment of risks and the ability of the individual or organization to control those risks. Individuals may turn down an assignment as unsafe when: • There is a violation of safe work practices. • Environmental conditions make the work unsafe. • They lack the necessary qualifications or experience. • Defective equipment is being used.

## Page 35

IRPG – Specific Hazards (Gray) 19 of 122 Steps to Follow When Turning Down Risk: • The individual directly informs their supervisor they are turning down the assignment as given. Use the criteria outlined in the Risk Management Process (10 Standard Firefighting Orders, 18 Watch Out Situations, etc.) to document the turn down. • The supervisor notifies the Safety Officer immediately upon being informed of the turn down. If there is no Safety Officer, the appropriate Section Chief or the IC should be notified. This provides accountability for decisions and initiates communication of safety concerns within the incident organization. • If the supervisor asks another resource to perform the assignment, they are responsible to inform the new resource that the assignment was turned down and the reasons why it was turned down. • If an unresolved safety hazard exists or an unsafe act was committed, the individual should also document the turn down by submitting a SAFENET (ground hazard) or SAFECOM (aviation hazard) form in a timely manner. These actions do not stop an operation from being carried out. This protocol is integral to the effective management of risk as it provides timely identification of hazards to the chain of command, raises risk awareness for both leaders and subordinates, and promotes accountability.

IRPG – Specific Hazards (Gray) 20 of 122 Hazard Tree Safety Hazard trees, both dead snags and live green trees, are one of the most common risks encountered on the fireline. All firefighters should frequently scan overhead to identify any trees that are leaning over their work area. Situation Awareness Environment: • Current and forecasted winds. • Night operations. • Steep slopes. • Diseased or bug-kill areas. • Number and height of hazard trees. • Anticipated burn-down time. • Potential for trees to domino. Hazard tree indicators: • Trees burning for any period of time. • High-risk tree species (rot and shallow roots). • Numerous downed trees. • Dead, broken, or burning tops, and limbs overhead. • Accumulation of downed limbs. • Absence of needles, bark, or limbs. • Leaning or hung-up trees.

## Page 37

IRPG – Specific Hazards (Gray) 21 of 122 Hazard Control • Eliminate the hazards with qualified sawyers, blasters/explosives, or heavy equipment. • Avoid hazards by designating No Work Zones (flag, sign, map, and communicate). • Modify suppression tactics or fireline location to avoid high-risk areas. • Post lookouts to help secure high-risk areas. • Utilize road/traffic controls in high-risk areas. • Fireproof potential hazard trees to prevent ignition. • Keep clear of bucket drops near trees/snags. • Reposition firefighters to secure areas in response to high winds in forecast. • Provide timely feedback to others regarding any hazard trees. In addition to suppression and mop up operations, assess, control, and monitor hazard trees along roads and when selecting break areas or campsites.

IRPG – Specific Hazards (Gray) 22 of 122 Powerline Safety Fire activity near high voltage electrical transmission/ distribution lines can cause multiple hazards and electrocute or seriously injure firefighters. The IC and line supervisors must be aware and communicate powerline hazards to all resources. Contact power companies when powerlines are threatened or involved. Down Powerlines • Communicate: Notify all responders of down electrical lines. Obtain radio check-back. • Identify: Determine entire extent of hazard by visually tracking all lines, two poles in each direction, from the downed wire. • Isolate: Flag area around down wire hazards, post guards. • Deny entry: Delay firefighting actions until hazard identification and flagging are complete, and/or confine actions to safe areas. • Downed line on vehicle: Stay in vehicle until the power company arrives. If vehicle is on fire, jump out with both feet together. Do not touch the vehicle. Keep feet together and shuffle or hop away. • Always treat downed wires as energized!

## Page 39

IRPG – Specific Hazards (Gray) 23 of 122 Ground Tactics • Normal tactics apply when fire is more than 100 feet from powerlines. • Heavy smoke and flames can cause arcs to ground. Direct attack must be abandoned within 100 feet of transmission lines. • Spot fires or low ground fires can be fought with hose lines if heavy smoke or flame is not within 100 feet of powerlines. • Always maintain a distance of 35 feet from transmission towers. • Never use straight streams or foam—use a fog pattern. • Use extreme caution if engaging in tactical firing operations. • Extinguish wooden poles burning at the base to prevent down powerline hazards. Aerial Tactics • Communicate locations of all transmission lines to air resources. • Aerial drops onto powerlines will cause arcing to ground or arcing to powerline towers and poles. • Drops should be parallel to lines and avoid drift making contact on the powerlines. • When flying across powerlines, cross at the towers. ALWAYS! • L ook Out for any powerlines near the incident. • C ommunicate location of all powerlines that present a hazard. • E scape Routes should not be under or near overhead powerlines. • S afety Zones, ICP, and staging areas should not be located under or near overhead powerlines.

IRPG – Specific Hazards (Gray) 25 of 122 Unexploded Ordnance Safety Unexploded ordnance (UXO) is most likely to be encountered on military or former military sites. UXO poses risk of injury or death to anyone in the vicinity. Situation Awareness • Early identification of potential UXO is the first and most important step in reducing the risk it poses. • Many types of UXO may be encountered: ○ Small arms munitions ○ Projectiles ○ Grenades ○ Rockets ○ Mortars ○ Guided missiles ○ Bombs ○ Submunitions • UXO may be found fully intact or in fragments. All UXO, whether intact or in fragments, presents a potential hazard and should be treated as such. • Deteriorated UXO presents a particular hazard because it may contain chemical agents that could become exposed. Hazard Control • If you see UXO, stop, and do not move closer. • Isolate and clearly mark the area. • Deny entry to others. • Never transmit radio frequencies near UXO. • Never remove anything near UXO. • Never touch, move, or disturb UXO. • Keep a minimum of 1,000 feet away from areas on fire that contain suspected UXO. • Report discovery of UXO to your immediate supervisor and/or dispatch. • U.S. Army Operations Center for incidents involving explosives and ammunition: 1-703-697-0218 .

IRPG – Specific Hazards (Gray) 26 of 122 Oil and Gas Site Safety When responding to an incident with oil and gas fields and/or coal seams, you must receive the appropriate training or a briefing before your operational assignment. Primary hazards include toxic gases as well as industry operations and facilities. Situation Awareness Methane (CH 4): • Toxic, flammable, odorless, and colorless. • Unlikely to cause physical problems in open environment but does pose a fire risk in high concentrations. • Beware of enclosed buildings/vehicles if gas is suspected. Hydrogen Sulfide Gas (H 2S): • Highly toxic, flammable, and colorless gas. • Odor of rotten eggs at low concentrations. • Sense of smell rapidly deteriorates at higher concentrations. • Exposure indicators include high heart rate, respiratory paralysis, seizures, and rapid incapacitation.

## Page 43

IRPG – Specific Hazards (Gray) 27 of 122 Hazard Control • Ensure contact is made with the appropriate authorities before engaging in suppression activities. • Ask for H 2S monitor/breathing apparatus and adequate briefing. • Do not depend on sense of smell for warning. • Avoid low-lying areas during stagnant air conditions. • Anticipate industry traffic on narrow, unimproved roads. • Be aware of exposed pipes and utility lines. • Park at least 20 feet away from facilities and equipment. Avoid tampering with the oil and gas pumping equipment. • Avoid open pits/dumps. • Before starting dozer operations, ask your local dispatch to notify the appropriate utility representative. Don’t assume pipelines are buried deeply or directly under their markers. • Seek immediate medical care at a hospital if H 2S exposure is suspected.

IRPG – Specific Hazards (Gray) 28 of 122 Smoke Hazards and Mitigation Line Personnel • Direct attack, line holding, and mop up resources have the highest smoke exposures. Symptoms of over exposure start with headaches and visual impairment, then impaired decision-making, and possible death (from carbon monoxide). If needed, rotate resources in and out of smoky areas. Consider exposure when developing mop up standards. • Use lookouts to monitor and communicate hazardous smoke conditions that may impact nearby roads. Make appropriate supervisory and/or safety notifications. ICP/Spike Camps • Ensure adequate rest and recovery from on-shift exposure to smoke. Avoid locating fire camps in drainages, valleys, or low-lying areas where smoke can concentrate at night or under inversion conditions. If camps can’t be moved, provide appropriate mitigation to ensure adequate rest and recovery from smoke exposure (e.g., clean-air sleeping trailer or hotel rooms). Public • Identify possible smoke sensitive areas (roads, communities, schools, hospitals, etc.) that may be impacted by smoke. Monitor smoke impacts. When heavy smoke is expected or present, notify authorities such as the air regulatory agency, health department, or public safety, either directly or through dispatch.

## Page 45

IRPG – Specific Hazards (Gray) 29 of 122 Smoke and Transportation Safety 1. Assess safety risks to personnel and public posed by smoke on roads. During initial attack and/or daily sizeup on extended attack, evaluate the potential of smoke to impact roadways up to 10 miles away. Identify drainages/topographic features that may allow for smoke to impact roadways during the night and early morning. 2. Thresholds that, when combined with smoke, indicate potential for reduced roadway visibility. Key Weather Variables Watch O ut Critical Surface Temperature ≤ 70 ᴼ F ≤ 55 ᴼ F Relative Humidity (RH) ≥ 70 % > 90 % Surface Wind Speed < 7 mph ≤ 4 mph Cloud Cover ≤ 60 % < 40 % 3. Hazard Control Mitigate when roadway visibility is expected to be impacted. Depending on thresholds projected and risk assessment, consider use of smoke observers, smoke signs, reduced speed limit, drone car, lead car, lane closure, or, if necessary, entire road closure. Notify appropriate authorities. Consider use of local, regional, or national air resource or meteorological specialists (Air Resource Advisors [THSP], Incident Meteorologist [IMET]).

Keep your fire shelter and, if time allows, your hand tool, water, and radio. • You may be able to use the fire shelter for a heat shield as you move. • In LIGHT FUELS, you may be able to move through the flames into the black. • If you are on the flank of the fire, try to get below the fire. • Consider vehicles or helicopters for escape. Find a survivable area. • Stay out of hazardous terrain features. • Use bodies of water. • In LIGHT FUELS, you may be able to light an escape fire. In other fuels, you may be able to light a backfire. • Call for helicopter or retardant drops. • Cut and scatter fuels if there is time. • Use any available heat barriers such as large rocks and dozer berms. • Consider vehicle traffic hazards on roads. • Structures and vehicles may be an option for temporary refuge.

## Page 47

IRPG – Specific Hazards (Gray) 31 of 122 Pick a fire shelter deployment site. • Your first priority is to maximize distance from nearest surface fuels. • Find the lowest point available. • If possible, pick a surface that allows the fire shelter to seal, and remove ground fuels. • Get into the fire shelter before the flame front hits. • Position your feet toward the fire and hold down the fire shelter. • Keep your face pressed into the ground and protect your airway. • Deploy next to each other and keep talking. Expect: • Extremely heavy ember showers. • Superheated air blast to hit before the flame front. • Noise and turbulent, powerful winds hitting the fire shelter. • Heat and fire glow inside the fire shelter. • Long deployment times…WHEN IN DOUBT, WAIT IT OUT. • Do not expect radio communication capabilities. • Do not expect water or retardant from aerial resources.

IRPG – Fire Environment (Orange) 35 of 122 Fire Environment Factor: Topography Indicators • Steep slopes (>45%) • Chutes/chimneys/passes/saddles • Box and narrow canyons • Slope reversals • Critical aspects and times on sunny days • Thermal belts Steep slopes , enhanced by drainages, draws, chutes, and chimneys, can produce instability over your fire and extreme upslope spread events. Gap winds (saddles and passes) can be gusty and erratic. Box and narrow canyons can hold heat, funnel winds, and support rapid increase in fire activity when inversion breaks. Slope reversals in narrow canyons can change backing fire to head fire. Be mindful of spotting potential and sunny aspects on the other side. Critical south and west aspects are in the sun during the peak burning conditions. Will fire be burning there then? Thermal belts should be factored into night operations. Learn the elevation of concern and when they set up. Dry fuels to burn intensely, wind to push them, instability factors from the sky, from the terrain, or from the fire itself. If they seem to align and raise your concerns, say something .

## Page 52

IRPG – Fire Environment (Orange) 36 of 122 Fire Environment Factor: Fuel Characteristics Indicators • Cured or curing grasses and leaves • Continuous loads of dead fine fuels • Heavy dead and down fuel loads • Tight crown spacing (<20’) • Tall (deep) grass and shrub fuel beds • Unusually low dead and live fuel moisture estimates (locally defined) Special Conditions • Efficient firebrand sources • Numerous snags • Ladder fuel loads • Flammable needle and leaf foliage • Fire damage and preheated canopy • Frost damage and bug-kill • Blowdown and slash accumulations Scout your assignment for where most burnable fuels are. What will carry the fire? Grass/shrub/litter/slash, its continuity, and how dry (drought, Energy Release Component (ERC), snap of sticks, crackle of litter, pop vs crumble of leaves, dust in duff). Is crown fire possible? Will fire in shrubs and trees breach your line and can surface/ladder fuels torch them? What damage do you see? Frost, scorch, slash, bug-kill. Dry fuels to burn intensely, wind to push them, instability factors from the sky, from the terrain, or from the fire itself. If they seem to align and raise your concerns, say something.

## Page 53

IRPG – Fire Environment (Orange) 37 of 122 Fire Environment Factor: Plume Dynamics Indicators • Well developed, near vertical column • Pyrocumulus or ice cap on column • Thunder/lightning flashes • Sprinkles of rain • Sudden calm • Becoming hazy, smoke at your feet • Changing column, alternating and strengthening inflows, and outflows First view of the fire is of the column while en route. Look for plume factors as indicators of instability, critical winds such as downdrafts and outflows. Read smoke column for what is burning, how intensely it is burning. On-scene factors (thunder/lightning, sprinkles, sudden calm, smoke at your feet) mean imminent wind changes. Fire Environment Factor: Rapidly Changing Fire Behavior Indicators • Smoldering fires pick up • Trees begin to torch • Firewhirls beginning • Leaning or sheared column • Increased frequency of spot fires Be mindful of critical burn period between 1400 and 1700. Monitor fire activity for notable changes. When does smoldering become spreading? First torching tree, first dust devil, first spot discovered. Increasing flame length. Dry fuels to burn intensely, wind to push them, instability factors from the sky, from the terrain, or from the fire itself. If they seem to align and raise your concerns, say something.

## Page 54

IRPG – Fire Environment (Orange) 38 of 122 Interpret the Smoke Column Stable Atmosphere: Trapping smoke under an inversion. Limited vertical motion of smoke, steady winds, higher smoke exposure levels, visibility likely reduced, and lower fire behavior. Watch Out: Smoke begins to boil through the inversion overcoming the stable layer. Expect lowering RH, possible wind shifts, and increasing flames, spread, and spotting. Unstable Atmosphere : Smoke rising high, disperses. Gusty winds, good visibility. Watch Out: Active spread, intense burning, large fire growth.

IRPG – Fire Environment (Orange) 39 of 122 Fire Danger Ratings and Interpretations Fire danger ratings are used in daily risk assessments and for operational preparedness by fire management agencies. Temperature, RH, winds, solar radiation, and precipitation estimates are the primary inputs. Fire danger information is useful during initial fire sizeup, initial attack, extended attack, and in fire prescriptions. Both the U.S. National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) and Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System’s Fire Weather Index (CFFDRS FWI) System are used in the U.S. Energy Release Component (ERC-NFDRS) and Buildup Index (BUI-CFFDRS) serve as good indicators of local seasonal fire danger trends resulting from the cumulative drying of fuels over days and weeks. They depend heavily on slower drying 100-hr., 1000-hr., and duff fuels. Burning Index (BI-NFDRS) and Fire Weather Index (FWI-CFFDRS) reflect changes in fine fuel moistures and windspeed and are highly variable day to day. They represent fireline intensity/flame length in a general sense. These are relative indices and should be compared to historic trends and thresholds on local area PocketCards. They can and should be reviewed along with morning forecasts. PocketCards are a tool for field personnel to locally track key fire danger outputs. PocketCards for a given area can be found at https://www.wildfire.gov/application/pocket-cards or by searching for Fire Danger PocketCard on the internet. Do not use the PocketCards for site-specific fire behavior predictions or fireline actions without an interpretative briefing.

IRPG – Fire Environment (Orange) 40 of 122 Critical Fire Weather The primary method NWS conveys critical fire weather patterns is by issuing Red Flag Warnings and Fire Weather Watches . Predictive service meteorologists issue High Risks . The four critical weather elements: • Low RH • Strong surface wind • Unstable air • Drought Critical fire weather patterns that support extreme fire behavior conditions can be separated into two primary categories: those that produce strong surface winds and those that induce atmospheric instability. Consider alignments. Drought: look for ERC/BUI at 90 th percentile or greater. Hot-Dry-Unstable: Look for terms in forecast, observed conditions. • Sunny for AM hours • Temps above normal • Poor RH recoveries • Weak inversion • Mid-level dry intrusion/slot • Thermal low/trough • High mixing heights/steep lapse rates • Heat wave Windy-Dry-Unstable: Look for terms in forecast, observed conditions. • Subsidence sector of tropical storms • Dry cold front passage/ wide gust spreads • Outflow, microburst, gust front, downdraft • Breakdown of upper-level ridge • Downslope • Offshore • Mountain wave • Strong jet • Monsoon burst • Land-sea breeze front • Migrating surface dry line Inversion Breaks: Fires become more active, perhaps rapidly. • Quick jump in temps, drop in RH, increased wind • Timing can vary by terrain, seasonality, latitude, and weather pattern change

IRPG – Fire Environment (Orange) 51 of 122 In Your Fire Weather Forecast Assessing the Potential for Lightning: • Are thunderstorm chances (in %) given in Sky/Weather section? • Higher percentages mean higher odds for storms and lightning. • Compare to Chance of Wetting Rain (CWR). A high thunderstorm chance with low CWR may imply dry thunderstorms. • Remember any thunderstorm can lead to ignitions from lightning. Assessing Impacts of the Mixing Height: • Mixing height represents the top of the near-surface, well- mixed layer expressed in feet above ground level (ft-agl). • A high or strong mixing height supports warmer, drier, and windier conditions at the surface. • High mixing height implies near-surface instability with gusting winds supporting erratic fire behavior potential. • Categorical high mixing height varies across the country. You need to assess if your mixing height forecast is high, average, or low for the time of year at your location.

IRPG – All Hazard Response (Yellow) 58 of 122 All Hazard Incident Response Wildland firefighters often respond to large scale disasters that can cover extensive geographic areas and impact many people. Often times these impacts are to large urban centers. Typical assignment tasks include search and rescue, debris clearing, and distribution of basic necessities. When responding, consider that basic services, utilities, transportation, medical care, credit card/ATM capability, and law enforcement and security will likely be disrupted. Be considerate of those impacted by the disaster. • Plan to be self-sufficient for 24 to 48 hours. • Bring a GPS unit if possible. • Be prepared for extreme weather conditions associated with storm disasters. • Establish central rally points for assigned responders. • Develop local contacts for information gathering. • Dust and debris may interfere with respiration and visibility. • Weakened structures, fires, leaking hazardous materials, raw sewage contamination, and waterborne diseases may pose additional risks. • Mobility and access may be impaired by critical infrastructure damage, disrupted utilities, structural collapse, flooding, ice covered roads, or other barriers. • In the case of natural disasters, be aware of the additional threats following the initial storm or earthquake.

IRPG – Aviation (Blue) 73 of 122 Aerial Delivered Retardant/ Water Drop Zone Considerations • Maintain prompt communications with aerial resources. Prioritize using the air-to-ground frequency as appropriate. • Keep informed of the aerial firefighting objectives, tempo, and aircraft type. • Evaluate your environment for gravity hazards (tree limbs, rocks, logs, and dispensed retardant/water). • If clearance is impractical, where fuels and/or terrain obstruct lateral movement from the path of the aircraft, notify the aerial supervisor immediately. If escape is not possible: • Lie face-down with head toward incoming aircraft with hardhat in place. • Hold hand tool away from your body. • If possible, grasp something firm to prevent being carried or rolled by the dropped liquid.

## Page 90

IRPG – Aviation (Blue) 74 of 122 Directing Retardant and Bucket Drops • Give general location on incident to aerial resource– division/head/heel/flank. • Identify any flight hazards to the ATGS, ASM/LP, airtanker pilot, or helicopter pilot. • Finalize location with: o Clock position from pilot’s perspective (see front cover). o Description of prominent landmarks. o Target position on slope – lower 1/3, upper 1/3, mid-slope, top of ridge, etc. o Utilize signal mirrors/strobe lights whenever possible. o Utilize panels or flagging to mark target as needed. • Describe target from your location and explain mission. The pilot will decide drop technique and flight path. • Know the pilot’s intentions prior to the drop. Clear the area to avoid direct flights over ground personnel and equipment. • Give feedback to pilot about drop accuracy. Be honest and constructive. Let pilot know if drop is early, late, uphill, downhill, on target, too high, too low, etc. Report low drops immediately.

## Page 91

IRPG – Aviation (Blue) 75 of 122 Principles for Airtanker and Water Scooper Use • Determine tactics, direct or indirect, based on fire sizeup and resources available. • Discuss strategy, tactics, wind conditions, and hazards with ATGS, ASM/LP, or pilot. o Establish a clear, obtainable objective for retardant use with aerial supervision. • Maintain effective communication with ATGS, ASM/LP, or pilot. • Establish an anchor point and work from it. • Order appropriate aircraft for mission based on objectives, terrain, and supporting ground resource tactics. • Use the appropriate coverage levels for the fuel type. See chart on page 77. • Drop downhill, into the wind, and away from the sun if possible. • Order airtankers early; aircraft are most effective during initial attack and early and late in the day. • Let ground resources know when there is an airtanker inbound. • Ensure approach, departure, and line are clear of personnel and equipment. • Inform ATGS, ASM/LP, or pilot when the drop area is clear. • Let ground resources know when drops are completed. • Get feedback from on-scene ground resources regarding drop effectiveness. • Relay feedback to aerial resource(s).

IRPG – Aviation (Blue) 78 of 122 Aircraft Mishap Response Actions Time is extremely critical when responding to an emergency. Immediate positive action is necessary; delay may affect someone’s survival. Rescue Operations • Preserve life. • Do whatever is necessary to extricate injured occupants and to extinguish fires. • Secure the area. • Document and/or photograph the location of any debris that must be disturbed in order to carry out rescue and/or fire suppression activities. • Identify witnesses and get contact information. Site Safety Precaution Aircraft wreckage sites can be hazardous for many reasons other than adverse terrain or climatic conditions. Personnel involved in the recovery, examination, and documentation of wreckage may be exposed to physical hazards such as hazardous cargo, flammable and toxic fluids, sharp or heavy objects, and disease. It’s important to exercise good judgment, use available protective devices and clothing, and use extreme caution when working in the wreckage.

IRPG – Aviation (Blue) 79 of 122 SAFECOM Reporting System The purpose of the SAFECOM system is accident prevention. It is a tool used to encourage the reporting of any condition, observance, act, maintenance problem, or circumstance that has the potential to cause an aviation or aviation-related accident. It can also be used for reporting positive safety actions and mishap prevention measures. Submitting a SAFECOM is not a substitute for on-the- spot correction(s) to a safety concern. While it is imperative that problems and issues be addressed at the local level, it is beneficial to share problems and solutions system wide. The SAFECOM system is not intended for initiating punitive actions. SAFECOM managers are responsible for protecting personal data and sanitizing SAFECOMs prior to posting to the public. Submit SAFECOMs at https://www.safecom.gov/ . Report any interagency aircraft mishap to: 1-888-464-7427 (1-888-4MISHAP).

IRPG – Aviation (Blue) 80 of 122 Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in Wildland Fire Operations Key Considerations for UAS Operations in Wildland Fire: • Awareness: Be aware of the presence of UAS in the operational area and their role in providing aerial support to firefighting efforts. Prioritize safety by following established protocols for interacting with UAS and respecting their operational space. • Compliance: All UAS operations must be authorized and comply with agency aviation/UAS policies, Federal carding requirements, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. All UAS/Remote Pilots are required to possess current FAA Airmen Certificate and agency approved Pilot Card for the assigned mission. • Communication: Communications with UAS are conducted on approved FM frequencies, UAS will not launch until positive communication has been established. • Launch and Recovery Sites: Type 3 and 4 UAS can be launched from multiple locations based on mission type. When possible, find sites with a clear operational view and outside of heavily traveled areas. Prior to requesting UAS consider the following: • Mission Objective – Situational awareness, imagery (stills/video), spatial data, aerial ignition. • Mission Timing – Optimal shift based on priorities and aviation activities. (Day/Night/Swing). • Product Delivery – How/when will information be shared. • Location of Line Personnel – Where are other ground resources working.

## Page 97

IRPG – Aviation (Blue) 81 of 122 Aerial Ignitions Using UAS in Wildland Fire Operations: UAS Aerial Ignitions (Ai): Ai operations require a dedicated firing boss/aerial ignition supervisor to direct UAS ignitions and coordinate with ground resources. These duties cannot be transferred to a UAS pilot during ignition operations. UAS Aerial Ignition (Ai) Capabilities: • Flight Time: 15-30 minutes with PSD. • Sphere Capacity: 450. • Camera: IR/EO video. • Within a TFR UAS can fly beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS). • Without a TFR UAS need to remain within sight or extended line of site (ELOS). Refer to https://uas.nifc.gov/ and the NWCG Standards for Fire UAS Operations, PMS 515, for further information on UAS operations.

IRPG – Other References (White) 83 of 122 OTHER R EFER ENC ES (w hite pa ges) Strategy – Direct Attack Advantages: • Minimal area is burned; no additional area is intentionally burned. • Safest place to work; firefighters can usually escape into the burned area. • The uncertainties of firing operations can be reduced/eliminated. Disadvantages: • Firefighters can be hampered by heat, smoke, and flames. • Control lines can be very long and irregular. • Burning material can easily spread across mid-slope lines. • May not be able to use natural or existing barriers. • More mop up and patrol is usually required.

## Page 100

IRPG – Other References (White) 84 of 122 Strategy – Indirect Attack Advantages: • Control lines can be located using favorable topography. • Natural or existing barriers can be used. • Firefighters may not have to work in smoke and heat. • Control lines can be constructed in lighter fuels. • There may be less danger of slopovers. Disadvantages: • More area will be burned. • Must be able to trade time and space for line to be constructed and fired. • Firefighters may be in more danger because they are distant from the fire and have unburned fuels between them and the fire. • There may be some dangers related to firing operations. • Firing operations may leave unburned islands of fuel. • May not be able to use control line already built.

## Page 101

IRPG – Other References (White) 85 of 122 Fireline Location • Firefighter safety is the first consideration of line location. • Whenever possible, use direct attack, and build line as close to fire edge as conditions safely permit. • If indirect attack is required, locate line an adequate distance from the main fire so it can be completed, fired, and held, considering the predicted rate of spread of the main fire. • Allow adequate time to permit forces to complete the line and conduct any firing operations in advance of severe burning conditions. • Make the line as short and straight as practical, using topography to your advantage. • Use easiest routes, taking advantage of light fuels, without sacrificing holding capability or significant resource values. • Use existing natural and human-made barriers. • Eliminate potential hazards from the fireline area whenever possible. If hazards must be left in the fire area, locate line a safe distance away. • Avoid undercut and mid-slope line in steep terrain. • Avoid sharp turns in the line. • Encircle area where spot fires are so numerous that they are impractical to handle as individual fires, then burn out the unburned fuels. • Lines that run along ridges should be located on the ridgetop or slightly to the lee side, away from the main fire. • Use the Downhill Fireline Construction Checklist (page 7) when considering building downhill line in steep terrain.

IRPG – Other References (White) 96 of 122 Line Spike The Line Spike, or Coyote, is a progressive line construction technique in which self-sufficient crews build fireline until the end of an operational period, remain overnight (RON) at or near that point, and then begin again the next operational period. Crews should be properly equipped and prepared to spend two or three shifts on the line with minimal support from the incident base. Safety Considerations • Can line spike locations maintain LCES at all times? • Can Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) be on the line? • Can a timely medevac plan be implemented? • Can daily communications (verbal and written) be maintained? • Can food and water be provided daily? • Is each crew leader comfortable with the assignment? Operational Considerations • Meals during line spike operational periods may consist of rations and/or sack lunches. • The line spike generally will not last more than two or three operational periods for any one crew. • Division Supervisors will be responsible for establishing on and off operational period times. • Crews working line spike operational periods will be resupplied on the fireline as close as possible to the RON point.

## Page 113

IRPG – Other References (White) 97 of 122 Logistical Considerations • Bring toothbrush/paste, extra socks/underwear, light coat, double lunch, space blanket, etc. • Consider early in the operational period where the crew(s) will RON and ensure the location provides for safety and logistical needs of the crew (main fire poses no threat, helicopters can longline or land at site, personnel are provided semi-flat ground to sleep on, adequate firewood exists for warming fires, etc.). • Anticipate resupply needs and place those orders early in the operational period. Crew leaders should make arrangements to have qualified individuals at RON locations to accept those orders by longline or internal helicopter operations. • Take measures to prevent problems with food, trash, etc., in areas where bears are a concern. It’s a common practice to leave one or more individuals with radio communications at the RON location to coordinate the backhaul of trash or the pre-positioning of reusable supplies to advanced RON locations. • Determine how crew time will be managed. Normally this function can be provided using inbound/outbound helicopter flights at the RON location, or the time is turned in upon returning to the incident base. • Determine how medical emergencies will be managed. An EMT may be needed at the RON location.

IRPG – Other References (White) 98 of 122 Minimum Impact Strategy Tactics Minimum Impact Strategy Tactics (MIST) is used to meet management objectives that seek to reduce environmental, cultural, and social impacts caused by typical suppression techniques. MIST can both limit resource damage and provide cost savings. Resource Advisors (READ/F) should be consulted regarding MIST implementation. However, the fireline supervisor will determine the tactics used based on firefighter safety, weather, fire conditions, and good judgment. MIST actions include but are not limited to: Line Construction and Mopup • Consider: o Cold trailing the fire’s edge. o Using wetline or sprinklers as control line. o Using natural or human-made barriers. o Burning out sections of fireline. o Limiting width and depth of fireline necessary to limit fire spread. • Locate pumps and fuel sources to minimize impacts to water sources. o Utilize containment berms around pump and fuel tank. • Minimize cutting of trees and snags to those that pose safety or holding concerns. • Move or roll downed material out of fireline construction area. • In areas of low spotting potential, allow large diameter logs to burn out.

## Page 115

IRPG – Other References (White) 99 of 122 • Limb only fuels with the potential to spread outside the line or pose spotting issues. • Scrape around tree bases near fireline to eliminate ladder fuel. • Minimize bucking of logs to check/extinguish hotspots, preferably roll logs to extinguish and return to original position. • Utilize extensive cold trailing and/or hotspot detection devices along perimeter. • Increase use of fireline patrol/monitoring. • Flush-cut stumps after securing fireline. Long-Term Incidents • Consult with READ/F to locate suitable campsites. Avoid areas with hazards (snags, bee nests, etc.). • Plan for appropriate methods of: o Helispots o Supply deliveries o Trash/Backhaul o Disposal of human waste • Minimize ground and vegetation disturbance when establishing sleeping areas. • Minimize disturbance of cultural resources. • Prevent spread of invasive species by checking/washing vehicles, cargo nets, and equipment. • Use locally approved storage methods to animal proof food and trash. • When abandoning camp, rehab impacts by fire personnel.

IRPG – Other References (White) 100 of 122 Reporting Fire Chemical Misapplication Wildland fire chemicals can have substantial negative impacts on aquatic life as well as some terrestrial species and cultural values. Therefore , it is very important to avoid application of fire chemicals into waterways and maintain familiarity with agency and local jurisdiction policies for aerial and ground delivery of wildland fire chemicals. Some agencies require avoidance and reporting for all wildland fire chemical misapplications into waterways, 300-foot riparian buffer zones, threatened and endangered s pecies habitat, or mapped avoidance areas. Inform your supervisor and/or READ/F if you encounter fire chemicals which may have been misapplied into any of these locations. • A waterway is any body of water including lakes, rivers, streams, and ponds – whether or not they contain aquatic life. • The 2009 Interagency Federal Policy for Aerial Delivery of Wildland Fire Chemicals near Waterways provides additional details, including exceptions.

## Page 117

IRPG – Other References (White) 101 of 122 Aquatic Invasive Species To minimize potential transmission of aquatic invasive species, it is recommended that you: • Consult with local resources, biologists, READ/Fs about known aquatic invasive species locations. • Draft/fill tanks from municipal or treated water sources when possible. • Avoid transfers of water between drainages/unconnected waters. • When drafting, avoid sucking organic and bottom material from a water source. • Use single water source if possible. Allow time for equipment decontamination/drying. • Remove all organic material/mud from equipment/gear external surfaces when possible. • Carry spare, clean, dry helicopter buckets, draft hoses, and foot valves to switch out with used ones when moving to a new water source. Decontaminate/dry the wet gear while spares are being used. Adhere to corrosion requirements for aluminum on aircraft fuselages or water delivery components such as helicopter buckets and foot valves when using chemicals. • If gear contacts untreated water, decontaminate gear before moving to new drainages. Applicable gear includes helicopter buckets, snorkel ends, foot valves, and draft hoses. Water delivery equipment and accessories that do not transfer tank water to waterbodies do not need to be disinfected (e.g., fireline hoses, wye valves, nozzles). For further direction refer to NWCG Invasive Species Subcommittee Guide to Preventing Aquatic Invasive Species Transport by Wildland Fire Operations , PMS 444, or local area or agency direction.

IRPG – Emergency Medical Care (Red) 107 of 122 EMERGENCY M EDICAL CARE (red pages) Emergency Medical Care Guidelines Legality: Do only what you are trained and authorized to do. Keep records of what you do for the patient. Blood-Borne Pathogens Use PPE (pocket mask, waterproof gloves, goggles) if contact with body fluids is possible. Treatment Principles • Prevent further injury by removing from danger. • Rapid assessment: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, and life- threatening injuries. • Thorough exam: Look for method of injury. Check for deformities, contusions, abrasions, punctures, burns, tenderness, lacerations, or swelling. • Stabilize patient. • Transport decision: air or ground extraction. • Document on-scene observations and treatment (send with patient). Medical Response Procedures • All injuries must be reported to direct supervisor. • In case of medical emergency, contact incident supervisor or communications dispatcher, and use the Medical Incident Report on page 120. • Medevac is an Incident Within an Incident (IWI). One person needs to become the on-scene IC and transfer command later if necessary. • Identify nature of incident, number injured, patient assessment(s), and location (geographic and GPS coordinates). • Do not use patient name(s) on the radio. • Determine transport plan (limited visibility or darkness may delay or negate air transport).

IRPG – Emergency Medical Care (Red) 110 of 122 Specific Treatments The following injuries may merit immediate transport. Bleeding: Direct pressure, elevate, and tourniquet if the first two actions fail to control extremity bleeding. Shock: Lay patient down, elevate feet, and keep warm. Fractures: Splint joints above and below injury. Monitor pulse and sensation before and after splinting the limb. Head Injury: Stabilize patient’s head and neck, maintain airway. Bee Sting (or other allergic reaction with rash, face, or airway swelling, difficulty talking/breathing): If the patient has an epi kit, assist them in using the medication. Burns: Remove heat source, cool with water, dry wrap, and give fluids if conscious. Eye Injuries: Wash out foreign material. Don’t open swollen eyes. Bandage impaled objects in place, and bandage both eyes if possible. Heat Stroke: Cool body as quickly as possible. See page 112 for additional information.

## Page 127

IRPG – Emergency Medical Care (Red) 111 of 122 CPR 1. Scene Safety: Look for any dangers or hazards. 2. Determine Responsiveness: Tap on the patient’s shoulders and shout, “Are you OK?” Look for chest rise and fall. If the patient is not breathing, continue with steps 3 and 4. If the patient is breathing and no spinal injury is suspected, place patient on their side. Continue to monitor breathing. 3. Call for Help: Activate emergency response. If possible, obtain an automated external defibrillator (AED). 4. Chest Compressions: Place the heel of one hand on the center of the patient’s chest. Place the other hand over the first and interlock the fingers. Perform compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute, compressing the patient’s chest at least two inches. Push hard and fast. Perform 30 compressions. 5. Airway: Open the patient’s airway by tilting the head back and lifting the chin. If trauma is suspected and you are trained, use the jaw thrust. 6. Breathing: If possible, use a barrier device. Place the barrier device over the patient’s nose and mouth. Pinch the patient’s nose and give 2 breaths, making the chest rise. If no barrier device is available, perform continuous compressions with no breaks or perform mouth-to-mouth. To perform mouth-to-mouth, pinch the patient’s nose and cover the patient’s mouth with your mouth. Form an airtight seal and give two breaths. 7. Continue CPR: Continue alternating 30 compressions and 2 breaths. If a second rescuer arrives, one person can perform ventilations and one person can perform compressions. Maintain the same 30:2 ratio. 8. AED: If an AED arrives, turn the AED on and follow the instructions provided.

IRPG – Emergency Medical Care (Red) 112 of 122 Heat-Related Injury Definition and Symptoms: • A heat-related injury (HRI) is a potentially fatal condition caused by elevated body temperatures from internal heat produced by activity or external environmental heat added to the body that cannot be removed to maintain a normal body temperature. • Symptoms of an HRI may be difficult to recognize and may occur in no particular order. If an individual shows any of the symptoms below they should seek medical attention. o Profuse sweating with warm or cool, clammy skin leading to hot, dry skin o Muscle cramps and weakness o Dizziness, headache, and irritability o Rapid, weak pulse o Vomiting o Mental status change, as simple as not talking as much o Loss of consciousness Steps to take if an HRI is suspected: • Cool the body as quickly as possible, then treat other conditions. o Cooling levels will depend on severity

## Page 129

IRPG – Emergency Medical Care (Red) 113 of 122 o Recovery of high body temperature requires:  Reduction of work output  Removal from sources of heat  Proper nutrition and hydration strategies Considerations for mitigation during firefighting: • Heat stress mitigations are not just a shift-to-shift concept. It is also task-to-task and even a minute-to- minute process. • Ability to handle heat is different between individuals and varies on a daily basis. • Performing physical tasks, such as hiking up hills, is our largest producer of body heat. o Hikes into a fire typically raise your body temperature 1–2 ° F from your pre-hike level. • At elevated body temperatures, risk of HRI has a lesser margin of error. • Maintain low skin temperature when possible, as it allows heat transfer from the body. • Pack weights exceeding 25% of body weight add to the demand of an activity. • Work expectations above physical fitness levels can increase risk of an HRI.

IRPG – Emergency Medical Care (Red) 114 of 122 Burn Injuries INITIATE MEDICAL EVACUATION IMMEDIATELY. • Remove person from heat source while looking for signs of a burned airway (e.g., singed facial or nasal hairs, soot or burns around or in nose, mouth, black sooty sputum, etc.). • Apply cool, clear water over burned area. Do not soak person or use cold water and ice packs, as this may cause hypothermia. • Examine for other injuries. - Provide basic first aid. - Monitor airway, breathing, circulation (ABCs). - Treat for shock by keeping person warm, feet elevated. - Provide oxygen, if available and trained to administer. • Assess degree of burn and area affected. – First Degree (Superficial) – Red, mild to moderate pain. – Second Degree (Partial Thickness) – Skin may be red and raw, blistered, swollen, painful to very painful.

## Page 131

IRPG – Emergency Medical Care (Red) 115 of 122 – Third Degree (Full Thickness) – Whitish, charred, or translucent, no pin prick sensation in burned area. – Rule of Palms: Patient’s palm = 1% of their body surface. Estimate how many times the patient’s palm could be placed over the burned areas to estimate the % of body that has been burned. • Cut away only burned clothing. Do not cut away clothing stuck to burned skin. Remove jewelry near injured area. • Loosely wrap burned area with clean, dry dressing, and moisten with clean water, and apply dry dressing on top. • For severe burns or burns covering large area of the body: – Loosely cover burned area with clean, dry dressing if available. – If dressings are unavailable, mylar blankets, plastic wrap, or clean blankets or clothing can be used. • Monitor ABCs. • Keep patient warm and dry. DO NOT use wet dressings or blankets. • Avoid hypothermia and overheating.

IRPG – Emergency Medical Care (Red) 118 of 122 Helicopter Extraction Operations The intent of helicopter extraction operations is to insert qualified personnel into inaccessible areas to extract a patient for transport to the nearest medical facility. These operations are not meant to be a medical transport resource; life flight or ground transport should be ordered in addition to the extraction aircraft and crew. ORDERING: • On-scene EMT or Medical Incident IC determines/ requests that medical extraction is required and coordinates the order through the Incident Management Team (IMT) or local dispatch. • Use the Medical Incident Report (page 120). Include the patient weight and name of on-scene radio contact. • Establish communications with incoming aircrew. Provide the following information: known hazards, terrain, wind speed/direction, patient update. CONSIDERATIONS: • Choose extraction site away from fireline or black edge. • Ensure the area is clear of non-essential items and personnel. Follow the directions of the aircrew. • Rotor wash may affect overhead hazards and blowing dust/debris can create brown out conditions.

## Page 135

IRPG – Emergency Medical Care (Red) 119 of 122 • Aerial Supervision is valuable for coordinating aviation medevac missions. • The aircrew will make the final assessment regarding the safety of the mission. Always have a contingency plan in case a helicopter cannot be used. • It is easy to become caught up in the urgency of a mission, especially those involving life-threatening situations. Regardless of the emergency, follow basic fireline and aviation safety procedures. Rescue Hoist: A cable winching device mounted to the helicopter that is capable of lowering/raising persons attached to the cable. Short-Haul: To transport one or more persons suspended on a fixed line beneath a helicopter. The intent is to transport persons a short distance (short- haul), normally from a limited or inaccessible location to a safe landing area.
