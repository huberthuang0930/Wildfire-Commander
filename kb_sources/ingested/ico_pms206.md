A Publication of the National Wildfre Coordinating Group INCIDENT COMMANDER’S ORGANIZER Te Incident Commander’s Organizer is designed to provide an IC with method to organize a rapidly evolving incident. Its use is voluntary and should be considered personal documentation. IC’s will adapt this system to the unique nature of each incident. Sponsored for NWCG publication by the NWCG Operations and Training Committee https://www.nwcg.gov/publications/206 PMS 206 NFES 2906 March 201 5

Indicators of Incident Complexity Common indicators may include the area (location) involved; threat to life, environment and property; political sensitivity, organizational complexity, jurisdictional boundaries, values at risk, and weather. Most indicators are common to all incidents, but some may be unique to a particular type of incident. The following are common contributing indicators for each of the fve complexity types. TYPE 5 Incident Complexity Indicators General Indicators Span of Control Indicators • Incident is typically terminated or concluded (objective met) within a short time once resources arrive on scene • For incidents managed for resource objectives, minimal stafng/oversight is required • Resources vary from two to six frefghters • Formal Incident Planning Process not needed • Written Incident Action Plan (IAP) not needed • Minimal efects to population immediately surrounding the incident • Critical Infrastructure, or Key Resources, not adversely afected TYPE 4 Incident Complexity Indicators • Incident Commander (IC) position flled • Single resources are directly supervised by the IC • Command Staf or General Staf positions not needed to reduce workload or span of control General Indicators Span of Control Indicators • Incident objectives are typically met within one operational period once resources arrive on scene, but resources may remain on scene for multiple operational periods • Multiple resources may be needed • Resources may require limited logistical support • Formal Incident Planning Process not needed • Written Incident Action Plan (IAP) not needed • Limited efects to population surrounding incident • Critical Infrastructure or Key Resources may be adversely afected, but mitigation measures are uncomplicated and can be implemented within one Operational Period • Elected and appointed governing ofcials, stakeholder groups, and political organizations require little or no interaction TYPE 3 Incident Complexity Indicators • IC role flled • Resources either directly supervised by the IC or supervised through an ICS Leader position • Task Forces or Strike Teams may be used to reduce span of control to an acceptable level • Command Staf positions normally not flled to reduce workload or span of control • General Staf position(s) normally not flled to reduce workload or span of control General Indicators Span of Control Indicators • Incident typically extends into multiple operational periods • Incident objectives usually not met within the frst or second operational period • Resources may need to remain at scene for multiple operational periods, requiring logistical support • Numerous kinds and types of resources may be required • Formal Incident Planning Process is initiated and followed • Written Incident Action Plan (IAP) needed for each Operational Period • Responders may range up to 200 total personnel • Incident may require an Incident Base to provide support • Population surrounding incident afected • Critical Infrastructure or Key Resources may be adversely afected and actions to mitigate efects may extend into multiple Operational Periods • Elected and appointed governing ofcials, stakeholder groups, and political organizations require some level of interaction • IC role flled • Numerous resources supervised indirectly through the establishment and expansion of the Operations Section and its subordinate positions • Division Supervisors, Group Supervisors, Task Forces, and Strike Teams used to reduce span of control to an acceptable level • Command Staf positions may be flled to reduce workload or span of control • General Staf position(s) may be flled to reduce workload or span of control • ICS functional units may need to be flled to reduce workload
