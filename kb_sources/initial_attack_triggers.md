# Initial Attack (0-3h) - Trigger Points (Training Aid)

This is a training-oriented checklist for InitialAttack IC Assist demos. Replace with your IRPG / agency doctrine when available.

## Evacuation triggers (recommendations, not orders)

- **Time-to-impact**: If projected spread reaches a community buffer (1 km) in <= 2 hours, recommend Evacuation Warning prep and LE coordination.
- **Wind shift**: If wind direction changes >= 30 degrees toward populated areas, elevate evacuation readiness.
- **Gusts**: Sustained wind > 10 m/s or gusts > 15 m/s can cause rapid spotting; increase trigger sensitivity.
- **Low RH**: RH < 20% materially increases spread potential; treat as higher risk.
- **Access/egress**: Single-road communities or limited evacuation routes should trigger earlier warnings.

## Resource triggers

- **Air support**: If head spread is projected to exceed available engine coverage within 60-90 minutes, request air early.
- **Dozer**: If anchor/hold line options exist within the next 30-60 minutes, prioritize dozer for rapid line construction.

## Safety constraints

- This tool provides decision support only. Confirm with local SOPs, dispatch, and evacuation authorities.
